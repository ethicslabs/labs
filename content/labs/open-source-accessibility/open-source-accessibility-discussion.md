Recall that the definition of Accessibility from the Oxford Dictionary
is threefold:

> 1.1 The quality of being easy to obtain or use.
> 
> 1.2 The quality of being easily understood or appreciated.
> 
> 1.3 The quality of being easily reached, entered, or used by people who
> have a disability.


**Using what you learned in your reading about the benefits of open
source software and of proprietary software,** consider with your group
the pros and cons of open source software with regard to each of the
sub-definitions of accessibility. Be prepared to discuss your answers
with the class.

1. Is open source software easy to obtain and use?
In what ways is it easy, and in what ways might it be hard?

2. Is open source software easily understood?
What is required for software to be understandable?
What do you know about open source software that might inform your
answer to this?

3. Is open source software easy to access by people with disabilities?
    Be sure to think about all of the different disabilities that you
    discussed with your class.

4. Would any of these be more or less likely to be a problem with
  open-source vs. proprietary software? Why?

### Virtue Ethics

You have explored the pros and cons of open source and proprietary
software. One of the ways to decide the best approach (proprietary or
open source) for creating software to support accessibility would be to
use the **virtue ethics** framework. Recall that this framework looks at
which virtues are upheld with a given decision, and which are violated.
Let us consider which of the virtues might be violated by the
proprietary approach and by the open source approach. 

5. Put a P by the virtues (listed below) violated by a purely proprietary
approach, and an O by virtues that might be violated by the purely open
source approach.

    You probably discovered that both approaches violate one or more
virtues. This is not straightforward!
{{% virtues-list %}}


### Utilitarian Framework

Letâ€™s turn to another framework. The utilitarian framework.
Utilitarianism suggests that the most ethical approach is the one that
is the best for the most people. 

6. Make a list below of the stakeholders involved in producing/using software
with an eye for all kinds of accessibility (economic, physical, mental).

7. Next to the stakeholder, make a list of their needs. 
The list is started for you as an example, but there are other stakeholders and 
other needs.

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 26%" />
<col style="width: 73%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Stakeholder</th>
<th>Need or contribution</th>

<tr class="odd">
<th><p>Software creators</p>
<p>(designers, developers, managers, maintenance etc.)</p></th>
<th><ul>
<li><p>Provide for themselves and/or their families</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the requirements of the application. What is its goal, who are its users, and what can realistically be implemented</p></li>
<li><p>Clear specifications for writing the code</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinate the efforts of the developers</p></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul></th>
</tr>
<tr class="header">
<th>General users</th>

8. You probably noticed that neither the open source approach or the
proprietary approach meet all of the needs of the stakeholders. Can you
create another approach that would do a better job?

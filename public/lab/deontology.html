<p><strong>Lesson plan</strong></p>
<p><u>Introduction</u> (to be read or summarized to class) (5 minutes)</p>
<p>Recall that ethics is the study of determining the right thing to do (in
a moral sense). In designing computer programs and performing data
analysis, there are lots of these types of decisions to be made. You may
have been introduced in previous modules of the virtue ethics framework
to assist in making a decision that is morally “best.” (If students have
seen the virtue ethics material, ask what they remember about it)</p>
<p>The virtue ethics framework asks the question “what would a virtuous
person do” to determine what is right. A virtuous person, according to
Aristotle, would have good underlying character traits that would cause
them to make good choices. The main benefit of this framework is that it
is very flexible. It can be applied to a wide variety of decisions.</p>
<p>What are some of the challenges of using the virtue ethics framework?
(Let students answer, but here are 2 obvious problems)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finding a truly virtuous person to make decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Some virtues may appear to be in conflict with each other (kindness
and honesty, for example), making the decision less obvious. (How to
answer someone who asks what you think of the book that they wrote
– when you don’t like it)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Would it be easier to just have a set of rules to follow that will
always produce the ethical action? This is the idea behind the
deontological approach to ethical decision making.</p>
<p>According to Oxford Languages, Artificial Intelligence is “the theory
and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally
require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.”</p>
<p>Any time you’ve written a computer program that uses “if statements”
you’re writing a program that makes decisions – that employs AI. What
examples can you think of? (let students answer)</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the students written programs determining GPA, whether a
password is strong enough, the next best move in a game, which loan
terms are better</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program basically consisted of a set of rules (an algorithm) for
making the decision. Perhaps the decisions your programs have made in
the past have not seemed like ethical decisions. A commonly cited
example of developing an ethical set of rules with AI is that of
programming a driverless car to decide who/what to hit when a collision
is inevitable. (The small group, the large group? The elderly person or
the younger person? Save the passengers or the pedestrians?)</p>
<p>But we will consider something more familiar: the assignment of a letter
grade. Most students have written a program to assign a letter grade
given a numerical grade. Commonly, 93 and above is an A, 90 up to less
than 93 is an A- etc. But how many times have you been close to a grade
and felt that just going by the rubric was not “fair”?</p>
<p><u>Activity (7-10 minutes)</u></p>
<p>Best to put the students into groups of 3-4. Can be completed
individually, however.</p>
<p>You will be asked to consider what letter grade should actually be
assigned (based on the numerical grade) from the virtue ethics
standpoint, and the deontological approach. When it comes to the
rules-based deontological decision making process, you may just want to
stick to the rubric (which already is a rule!), or you may want to take
other things into consideration.</p>
<p><u>Reflection (to be completed in class after the activity is finished)
(10-15 minutes)</u></p>
<p>Have class come back together. Each group should explain their virtue
ethics decision (along with the virtues that influenced the choice).</p>
<p>Once all groups have voiced their virtue ethics conclusion, have each
group provide their algorithm.</p>
<p>If students have had a hard time coming up with an algorithm, or if the
algorithms are too simple, consider discussing the following things that
might come into play (not saying they should!):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did the student have one exam or assignment that was
uncharacteristically low?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the student ready to graduate (and an F would keep them from
graduation)</p></li>
<li><p>Did the student have a personal trauma during the semester</p></li>
<li><p>Is the professor confident that the student did their own work all
semester, or is there evidence that was not the case</p></li>
<li><p>How did the rest of the class do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss the different approaches (virtue ethics vs. deontological) and
the challenges and benefits of each in this scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deontological would provide a more uniform decision and is easier on
the person making the decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtue ethics is flexible – you do not have to try to come up with
a rule for every possibility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss also, the relationship between the 2 approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students may observe that rules are related to virtues –
compassion, for example, if a student had a particularly bad week</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up with a set of rules is often helpful, though challenging. Some
companies or organizations come up with guidelines that are helpful, but
that leave room for interpretation or special cases. The most famous is
the American Medical Association’s “do no harm.” The Association for
Computing Machinery (or ACM -the main Association for computing
professionals) has a code of ethics. Part of this code of ethics is
found on the second page (or backside) of the student handout. Let the
students read and comment if there is time.</p>
<p><u>Assessment</u> (to be included later on a quiz, paper, or exam to
determine if learning objectives were reached)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Briefly describe the deontological approach to determining if
something is the right course of action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following a set of rules or guidelines. If a course of action
adheres to the rules, it is the right thing to do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What are the benefits of the deontological approach and what are the
drawbacks</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Benefit is that the result is more uniform and easier for the
person deciding</p></li>
<li><p>Drawback is that it is hard to come up with a set of rules that
covers every possibility</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Provide a scenario and ask student to come up with a set of rules to
ethically decide the outcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask student to identify a set of rules that society follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traffic rules</p></li>
<li><p>Ten Commandments</p></li>
<li><p>Classroom rules</p></li>
<li><p>Any set of governmental laws</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How is artificial intelligence related to the deontological
approach?</p>
<ul>
<li>Both follow a set of rules to make decisions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Name one article of the ACM Code of Ethics</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />

<p><strong>AI Algorithm Handout</strong></p>
<p>Scenario: After taking the final exam, the student’s course grade is
59.5% (on a scale where passing is 60%).</p>
<p><strong>Address the grade issue using virtue ethics:</strong></p>
<p>What grade would the virtuous professor assign? Would it make a
difference if the grade was between an A- and an A? What virtues would
be involved in the decision?</p>
<p><strong>Address the grade issue using deontology:</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to write a program that will determine grades so
that the grade assignment is less subjective. Come up with an algorithm
(for that program) for assigning grades when a student is on the
borderline between two grades.</p>
<p><strong>Partial ACM Code of Ethics</strong></p>

all people are stakeholders in computing.</p></li>

<li><p>Be honest and trustworthy</p></li>
<li><p>Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative

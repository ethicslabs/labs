Below is a list of five ways you could get involved with the integrated
ethics labs project. Each description includes a summary of the amount
effort/commitment required and the corresponding recognition. We are
absolutely open to other suggestions, and **we welcome your
involvement!**

## Submit your own pre-tested lab

-   [Submit an ethics lab](mailto:info@integratedethicslabs.org) that
    you have written and used several times successfully. Ideally, you
    will also attempt to transform it into the same style that is found
    on the labs currently posted.

-   The lab will undergo a blind peer review by at least two reviewers.

-   If the reviewers agree that the lab is suitable in content and
    length and references at least one of the four ethics frameworks
    used by integrated ethics, it will be tested with a class or focus
    group.

-   If the outcome is positive, any additional style-updates deemed
    necessary will be made by the integrated ethics team. Given that the
    original author approves these changes, the lab will be posted on
    the site and attributed to the author.

**Recognition**

Author gets credit for a peer reviewed publication.

## Become a peer reviewer

-   [Let us know of your interest](mailto:info@integratedethicslabs.org)
    in being a peer reviewer, indicating your general academic
    discipline (mathematics, data science, computer science) and a
    subspecialty if desired.

-   As the need arises, we will contact you regarding your availability
    to review.

-   A peer review is only a content review. You would be reviewing
    discipline content along with style. Discipline content refers to
    whether the examples used are true and important to mathematics,
    data science, or computer science as required by the lab. Style
    includes lab sections (Placement, Time, Learning objectives, etc.)
    and comments on writing (readability, grammar, etc.) A peer review
    form will be provided.

**Recognition**

Reviewer receives a contribution letter suitable for inclusion in a
tenure or post-tenure review portfolio.

## Become a class or focus group ethics lab tester

This is an essential contribution. Many labs look good on paper but are
not well-received by the students or hard to present for the non-author
professor.

-   [Let us know of your plan to
    test](mailto:info@integratedethicslabs.org) and we will send the
    appropriate materials.

-   Read the entire lab several times.

-   Create any materials necessary for presenting the lab.

-   Present the lab to a class or other student group.

-   Administer a pre/post survey to the participants.

-   Fill out a questionnaire that addresses student reception, ease of
    presentation, and plans for future use.

**Recognition**

Tester receives a contribution letter suitable for inclusion in a tenure
or post-tenure review portfolio.

## Provide a testimonial

[Write and submit a thoughtful
testimonial](mailto:info@integratedethicslabs.org) of 150-250 words
explaining your use of the labs and the impact made on you or your
students.

-   Did the labs change your thinking, or your desire to influence
    students to consider ethical implications?

-   Did a student report that a lab caused them to act or to speak to
    someone regarding an ethical issue?

-   Did a student report making a job choice based on the perceived
    ethicality of the product or management represented by the company?

-   Other impact ??

**Recognition**

If selected, the testimonial will be posted on the Integrated Ethics
website along with the author's name.

## Co-author a conference paper

Once we have collected more data on the efficacy of the labs, we
anticipate producing one or more papers. If you have contributed in
multiple of the ways listed above, or in a major way not listed, we
would certainly consider having you join the author team.

**Recognition**

Co-author on a peer reviewed paper. More limited contributions could
result in an acknowledgement in the body of the paper.

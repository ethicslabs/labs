# Overview

**Summary:** In a previous lab, ethics was defined as “the study of what it means to
‘do the right thing’”. The question then, is how do we know what is the
right thing? This lab introduces the 3 ethical frameworks used in future
labs. It begins to consider the virtue ethics framework at a very high
level along with introducing the use of the other frameworks.

**Ethics background** required: None

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab: computer and data science
tasks

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

-   If the first year groundwork sequence is incorporated into a
    program, this lab should be assigned as homework after the “Why
    Ethics?” lab and prior to completing the Virtue Ethics lab in
    class

-   If other labs are being used as stand-alone labs, this is a good
    homework assignment to use to introduce students to the ethics
    frameworks prior to completing any other lab.

**Time required:**  

* As homework: 25 minutes

**Learning objectives:**

-   Students are introduced to the 3 ethical frameworks that are
    considered in future labs

-   Students become familiar with virtue-terms

-   Students understand that virtues are characteristics that can be the
    basis for wise decisions

-   Students try to apply one or more frameworks to make a decision
    about an ethical dilemma.

-   Students have opportunities to practice thoughtfully articulating
    their convictions


**Ethical issue to be considered:** data visualization, accessibility

**Flow**

-   Students are reminded of what "ethics" is

-   Students are introduced to the three ethical frameworks to be
    applied in future labs

-   Students are asked to reflect on someone who they believe is of high
    moral character

-   Students are asked how they believe their moral hero would respond
    to a situation based on their virtues.

-   Students consider the application of another ethical framework to
    the same situation.

**Preparation required:** 

* Read the entire lab several times to become familiar with the material. 
* Print or post the student homework assignment. 
* Consider questions that might be asked in class after the students have 
completed the assignment. 

    Here are two possibilities:

    -   Describe your moral hero and their most significant virtue

    -   To which scenario did you respond, and which framework was the most
    helpful? Summarize your conclusion to the ethical dilemma based on
    that framework.

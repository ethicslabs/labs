# Student Materials

* Worksheet

    * [web version](analogies-code-plagiarism-worksheet/)
    * [Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrated-ethics/web/main/content/labs/analogies-code-plagiarism/analogies-code-plagiarism-worksheet.md)

 
# Overview

**Ethics background** required: Knowledge of three primary frameworks
is helpful, but can be breifly presented in this lab.

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab: Computer programming

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

* Academic year: First year, second semester, programming course

* Recommended previous labs: Virtue Ethics, Introduction to the Deontology Framework Using AI, Utilitarianism- Plagiarism Issues

* Recommended follow-up labs: Any of the Application Labs

**Time** required:

* Out of class: None

* In class: 30 minutes

**Learning objectives**:

-   Introduce and apply analogies as a way of evaluating ethical
    dilemmas

-   Explore plagiarism as an ethical issue

-   Practice articulating when analogies are helpful and when they are
    not


*Ethical issue to be considered:* professional ethics, intellectual
property, plagiarism

This lab introduces a new tool for grasping the ethicality of a new
area that is similar to more well-understood predicaments. Since
computer science and data science are still new areas of work and study,
analogies to older disciplines can be helpful. It is not a commonly
accepted "ethical framework."

**Flow**

-   Review frameworks: virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism

-   Introduce the concept of analogies as a tool for help with decision
    making

-   Distribute and work on handout with group

-   Class discussion on using plagiarism in writing essays as an analogy
    for plagiarism in coding

-   Class Reflection on usefulness of analogies


# Guide for Instructors 

## Lesson plan

### Introduction (to be read or summarized to class)

At this point you may have seen several ethical frameworks that can help
make decisions regarding the morally right course of action.
Possibilities are:

**Virtue ethics**: Makes the choice by using the question "what would
the virtuous person do?"

**Deontology**: Makes the choice by determining if the action adheres to
a set of rules related to the context of the decision.

**Utilitarianism:** Makes the choice by determining if the benefits of
the action outweigh the costs of the action.

Sometimes, before any of these frameworks can be used, it is helpful to
just understand the situation better. The computer and data science
fields are new enough and dynamic enough that there is limited or no
precedence for dealing with a particular situation. This is where an
analogy can be helpful.

An analogy is saying something is like something else for the purpose of
clarification. Generally the concept in the analogy is better understood
than the dilemma in question, and might help in understanding the
less-familiar predicament.

A frequent example from computing is using an analogy to understand the
ethicality of hacking into a person's computer, just to look around. Is
this OK if the hacker makes no changes and steals no data? Most people
have an opinion on this action now, but it was confusing when it was
first occurring. The analogy commonly used has nothing to do with
computing, but can share the concepts of looking around but not
stealing. This analogy would be a person breaking into another person's
house and looking around, but not damaging or stealing anything. The
concept of breaking and entering in the context of the home had been
defined by society as unethical. Probably, then, entering someone else's
computer would also be unethical.

Keep in mind that analogies are imperfect. There is generally a point
where the comparison no longer holds. In the case of "looking around the
house" while the perpetrator may gain knowledge about the layout, for
example, if the person doesn't actually take something, no theft
occurred. However, in looking around a computer, it is easy to steal
without even doing a copy/paste. Furthermore, stealing data can cause
future extensive damage while stealing jewelry is an end in itself.

### Activity

We are going to try to gain some insight into ethically writing computer
programs by comparing them to writing essays. Most students have written
many essays in their lives, but writing computer programs is not as
familiar. Work through the exercise with your group, and then we will
come back together do discuss where the analogy worked, and where it did
not


### Reflection

-   Ask how students filled out the rest of the grid on the worksheet.
Some answers are provided here:

**Essay**                    |    **Computer program**
---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Follows an outline           | Follows and outline/algorithm
Addresses a prompt           | Addresses a prompt/problem to be solved
There are an infinite number of ways to write about the same topic. | There are infinite number of ways to create code that does the same thing.
Proper grammar is important. | Even more important with programming to avoid syntax errors.
It is a combination of terms written in a particular language | Yes, even fewer terms are available although you can "make up" new terms (identifiers)
Different writers have different styles | Yes! Some favor different kinds of loops or conditional statements. Some use more subroutines, use unique identifier naming conventions, spacing, commenting. Some combine operations into 1 instructions and some provide several.

Where the analogy breaks down:

<!---   The order of statements in a computer program must be somewhat
    predictably sequential in order to run. The order of information in
    an essay could vary significantly. -->

-   Computer programs either run or they don't. An essay can be
    acceptable even though it is not excellent. Less middle ground on
    programs. You can't test an essay to see if it is correct.
    
- Computer programs are unambiguous. Ambiguity can be used intentionally
or introduced accidentally by the author of an essay.

-   Go through each type of writing plagiarism and try to determine if
    it fits. Here are some ideas, but should hear from students first.

    * **Complete plagiarism:** copying an entire program

    * **Source-based:** not clearly analogous

    * **Direct:** perhaps getting pieces of a solution to a program from
various people and putting it together as your own

    * **Self:** This more applies to publishing. Probably not an issue if
it's not represented as brand new material

    * **Paraphrasing**: Changing variable names and turning it in as your
own

    * **Inaccurate authorship:** someone else wrote the program for you even
though it was new, or, you gave a program that you had written to
someone (both people culpable)

    * **Mosaic:** Parts of the program are yours, and parts someone else's.
This can be an interesting discussion about copying snippets from a
book.

    * **Accidental**: Someone did not understand that what they were doing
was plagiarism (e.g., they thought they were making their code unique by
re-ordering or changing variable names).

-   Have students discuss how helpful this analogy was in increasing
    understanding of what is ethical to do in the process of writing a
    computer program as a student. Note that things might be slightly
    different in industry as code re-used might be the property of the
    company. Re-use of your or other's code in that context might not be
    plagiarism.


### Assessment 

-   What is an analogy?

-   How can analogies be useful?

-   Provide students with a scenario and ask them to identify the
    ethical dilemma along with a non-technical analogy that helps to
    clarify the situation. Example: Game company X is frequently coming
    out with new versions of their game to keep their income stream
    constant which allows them to reliably meet payroll. However,
    constant releases encourage teens to spend more time on the game and
    to crave the latest and greatest. What is the ethical dilemma, what
    is a non-tech analogy that might shed light on how to handle that
    dilemma?

-   Students might see addiction to food, drugs, tobacco, or alcohol as
    a parallel. They may decide that a solution would be a warning on
    the game (analogous to calorie disclosures for food), creating games
    that are less addictive, raising the price of the game (analogous to
    tobacco taxes) to support the income stream instead of frequent
    releases.

-   Care should be paid when making use of an analogy. What problems can
    arise with analogies?

    -   trying to force one that doesn't really work and drawing wrong
        conclusions from it

### Additional help on analogies for instructors

We use analogies to compare two things that have similarities. Often,
the student is more familiar with the analogous object or idea, so it
can help us reason about the more unknown counterpart. See the
introduction for an extended description and example, or see the links
below for more examples of analogies being used. Links accessed 6/2019

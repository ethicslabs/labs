<p><strong>Lesson plan</strong></p>
<p>[Technology Fast Homework]{.ul}</p>
<p>1 week before the discussion, hand out the following activity prompt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Please choose one day this week where you will &quot;give up&quot; (entirely
refrain from using) some tech device, app, or activity for just one
day (eg. social media, gaming, texting etc.). The activity should be
one that you use regularly in your daily life, but not one that would
imperil your academic success in other courses. In your reading
response, use your &quot;personal reflection&quot; section to comment on the
experience of this small &quot;technology fast&quot;. Was it difficult to do?
How did it make you feel? What did you find your thoughts turning to?
Would you consider making a &quot;technology fast&quot; part of your regular
life rhythms? What is it about the design of this product that causes
it to feel so compelling?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Student should submit their choice of particular technological</p>
<blockquote>
<p>activity and a particular day <em>before</em> the fast.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student should complete the technology fast and submit their</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reflection write-up at least one day prior to the class
discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[In-class Activity (30 min)]{.ul}</p>
<p>(5 minutes) Invite student comments on the results of the technology
fast.</p>
<p>(2 minutes) Watch the following video, promoting a book on how to make
software habit-forming:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qWEldj_jJ9E">[https://youtu.be/qWEldj_jJ9E]{.ul}</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(For a longer treatment of this topic, you may want to consider the
documentary The Social Dilemma.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(10 minutes) Discuss both the techniques described in the promotion, and
the ethics of using those techniques. Draw out from the students the
situations in which these techniques may be appropriate, and those in
which they would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>Have the students identify which ethical frameworks they are using to
make these judgements. (Virtue, deontological, utilitarian)</p>
<p>(10 minutes) Broadening the discussion</p>
<p>Virtue Ethics:</p>
<p>What virtues are applicable when confronted with this issue?</p>
<p>How are habits and virtue linked?</p>
<p>Deontological Ethics:</p>
<p>Are there rules in the ACM code of ethics that would address this topic?</p>
<p>Utilitarian Ethics:</p>
<p>Who are the stakeholders? Who benefits? Who is negatively affected?</p>
<p>What are the societal impacts if this technology becomes ubiquitous?</p>
<p>If your boss asked you to design software using addictive techniques,
how would you respond? (What other design choices or even business
models could be suggested that don&rsquo;t have these concerns? How could a
different design give the user of the product more control over their
own behavior?)</p>
<p>[Assessment]{.ul} (to be included at a later date on a quiz, paper, or
exam to determine if LOs were reached)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What ideas did the class come up with for responses to the boss&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>request to develop an addictive product?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>What changes are you considering in your life after your technology</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fast and/or hearing comments from your classmates?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using one or more of the Ethical Frameworks, describe why designing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>products to be intentionally addictive is ethically problematic?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>U.S Patriot Missile Defense Scenario</p>
<p>In February of 1991, a U.S. Patriot missile defense system in Saudi
Arabia, failed to detect an attack on an Army barracks. A government
report found that a software problem led to an inaccurate tracking
calculation that became worse the longer the system operated.</p>

<p>U.K.&rsquo;s Child Support Agency Scenario</p>
<p>In 2004, EDS introduced a highly complex IT system to the U.K.&rsquo;s Child
Support Agency (CSA). At the exact same time, the Department for Work
and Pensions (DWP) decided to restructure the entire agency. The two
pieces of software were completely incompatible, and irreversible errors
were introduced as a result. The system somehow managed to overpay 1.9
million people, underpay another 700,000, had US$7 billion in
uncollected child support payments, a backlog of 239,000 cases, 36,000
new cases &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in the system, and has cost the UK taxpayers over
US$1 billion.</p>

<p>Y2K Problem Scenario</p>
<p>The Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem, the Millennium
bug, Y2K bug, the Y2K glitch, or Y2K, refers to events related to the
formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year
2000. Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs
represented four-digit years with only the final two digits &ndash; making
the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. The assumption of a
twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such
as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of
automated dated records or real-time events.</p>

<p>NASA&rsquo;s Mars Climate Orbiter Scenario</p>
<p>On its mission to Mars in 1998 the Climate Orbiter spacecraft was
ultimately lost in space. Although the failure bemused engineers for
some time it was revealed that a sub contractor on the engineering team
failed to make a simple conversion from English units to metric. An
embarrassing lapse that sent the $125 million craft fatally close to
Mars' surface after attempting to stabilize its orbit too low. Flight
controllers believe the spacecraft plowed into Mars' atmosphere where
the associated stresses crippled its communications, leaving it hurtling
on through space in an orbit around the sun.</p>

<p>Ariane 5 Flight 501 Scenario</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s newest un-manned satellite-launching rocket reused working
software from its predecessor, the Ariane 4. Unfortunately, the Ariane
5&rsquo;s faster engines exploited a bug that was not found in previous
models. Thirty-six seconds into its maiden launch the rocket&rsquo;s engineers
hit the self destruct button following multiple computer failures. In
essence, the software had tried to cram a 64-bit number into a 16-bit
space. The resulting overflow conditions crashed both the primary and
backup computers (which were both running the exact same software). The
Ariane 5 had cost nearly $8 billion to develop, and was carrying a
$500 million satellite payload when it exploded.</p>

<p>Heathrow Terminal 5 Opening Scenario</p>
<p>Just before the opening of Heathrow&rsquo;s Terminal 5 in the UK, staff tested
the brand new baggage handling system built to carry the vast amounts of
luggage checked in each day. Engineers tested the system thoroughly
before opening the Terminal to the public with over 12,000 test pieces
of luggage. It worked flawlessly on all test runs only to find on the
Terminal&rsquo;s opening day the system simply could not cope. It is thought
that &ldquo;real life&rdquo; scenarios such as removing a bag from the system
manually when a passenger had left an important item in their luggage,
had caused the entire system to become confused and shut down. Over the
following 10 days some 42,000 bags failed to travel with their owners,
and over 500 flights were cancelled.</p>

<p>Financial Software Scenario</p>
<p>A customer using a financial software package preparing for an upcoming
client meeting. The financial advisor is reviewing his presentation and
recognizes that the investment earning for his client are showing a
negative value when he is certain that the investments have made a gain.
The financial advisor calls the software company asking if he has used
the software incorrectly or if there is a known error. The customer
service representative says that she is not aware of a known error, but
will ask the maintenance programmers to look into the problem. The
programmers had a very difficult time finding the bug, but a week later
they located it. Unfortunately, in the absence of the software, the
financial advisor had to reschedule and lost the client due to the
delay.</p>

<p>Accounting System Scenario</p>
<p>A computer company is writing the first stage of a more efficient
accounting system which will be used by the government and will save
taxpayers a considerable amount of money. A software engineer is asked
to design a user interface for the system. The accounting system and the
interface contain all of the functionality described in the
requirements. The system is installed, but the user interface is so hard
to use that the complaints of the customer's staff are heard by the
customer's upper level management. Because of these complaints, upper
level management will not invest any more money in the development of
the new accounting system and they go back to their original more
expensive system.</p>

incoming aircraft as friend or foe. A software engineer developed a user
interface which will display needed information. This information can be
used to determine if defensive action is necessary. The radar system and
the interface contain all of the functionality described in the
requirements. Although all of the information required was displayed, it
was not displayed in a way that was adequate for them to distinguish a
military attack plane from a commercial airliner. This contributed to
the loss of many lives.</p>

<p>The general definition of the word &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; according to Webster&rsquo;s
Dictionary is &ldquo;giving the same result on successive trials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to ANSI/IEEE, software reliability is defined as: the
probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of
time in a specified environment.</p>

<p>Junior Programmer Scenario</p>
<p>One of the main clients of ACME Programming Associates is Always
Airways. Always Airways has employed ACME to create simulators for
training their pilots on various aircraft. One simulator needs to be
updated because the 2020 version of commuter planes used by Always
contains an air circulation monitor that was not previously included on
the cockpit dashboard. The updated simulator needs to be ready for
training pilots next week. They are on a very strict timeline but the
only programmer available to ACME is Kim, a fairly new college graduate
who has only been with the company for 2 months and just finished her
training on the company&rsquo;s proprietary IDE. Since the addition of the
monitor to the dashboard should be a fairly simple change, Kim is
assigned to the job. Kim tested the addition to the best of her ability,
but did not realize that the units used for air circulation could
produce values up to 100 billion. Hence, when the simulator was used by
the pilots, negative numbers appeared.</p>

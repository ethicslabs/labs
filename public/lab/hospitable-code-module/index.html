<p>Hospitality Module</p>
<p>Module Summary</p>
<p><strong>Ethics background</strong> desired: Virtue Ethics, Analogies, Utilitarianism,
&amp; Deontology. If students or professor are not familiar with these
frameworks, a brief summary is provided in the reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Subject matter</strong> referred to in this module: Hospitable computer
programming (Exercise written in C++ (uses pointers and vectors), and
also Java). Could be adapted to another language if preferable.</p>
<p><strong>Placement</strong> in overall ethics curriculum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Academic year:</strong> Years 2-4. To reinforce the need for good
programming techniques we recommend using it earlier rather than
later! We use this first semester of sophomore year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended previous modules:</strong> First Year Curriculum</p>
<p><strong>Recommended follow-up modules</strong>: Reliability module</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> required:</p>
<p>Out of class: None (but potential online version available if unable to
do in class)</p>
<p>In class: 25-30 mins</p>
<p><strong>Learning objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider the importance of documentation, good programming
practices, and user-friendliness from the user and programmers'
perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice using an ethical framework to discuss the need for
hospitable coding with a team member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module overview</strong>:</p>
<p>[Ethical dilemma or issue to be considered]{.ul}: </p>
<p>The ethical issue focused on in this module is hospitality. Hospitality
is defined by Dictionary.com as the friendly reception and treatment of
guests or strangers. As students, often the only motivation for
hospitable programming practices is the grade. This exercise should help
point out that it is frustrating and time-consuming to both code users
and code maintainers (our guests and strangers) to try to deal with code
that is not well-written and well-documented.</p>
<p>[Exercise flow:]{.ul}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run the code given, asking the class to figure out what the game is
from only the output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass out the code and task students with making it more
user-friendly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the challenges encountered in altering the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on past and future behavior with regard to hospitable coding</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the entire module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide which language you would like to present the exercise in (C++
and Java versions are provided but you may want to transcribe to
Python or another language to meet your needs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load the chosen code on your computer and make sure that it runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print copies of the code so that each student or pair of students
can have a copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a way to display (PowerPoint slide or other) the reasons that
students may not use hospitable programming practices and possibly
the review of the ethical frameworks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructors Guide</p>
<p><strong>Lesson plan</strong></p>
<p>[Introduction]{.ul} (5 min)</p>
<p>Start by running the code. Choose a student to play the coded game and
tell the class that they are tasked with figuring out what the game does
as their peer plays it. The prompts for the user are one of the
inhospitable aspects of the code so let the student chosen to interact
with the game struggle in responding. (The game is similar to Blackjack,
but the goal is 20 instead of 21. This may also be an inhospitable
aspect since there are not instructions). For the C++ version, a &ldquo;seed&rdquo;
is required for the random number generator and this is also awkward.</p>
<p>[Activity (15 min)]{.ul}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hand out a copy of the code to each student or group of 2 students.
Ask them to work on making the code more user friendly. (In order to
do this, they will have to try to understand the code, and this
presents many other inhospitable aspects of the code)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the class comes back together, ask students what they changed
in order to make the code more user-friendly. Hopefully, some of
them can talk about adding instructions, adding better prompts etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the students were successful or not, talk about what made
the process difficult. Answers should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meaningless variable names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of pointers in the C++ code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meaningless function names</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[Reflection (10 min)]{.ul}</p>
<p>Ask students to consider (silently) common student behaviors with
respect to hospitable programming practices. They should be able to
relate to many! This list should be displayed as previously prepared.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I put in plenty of comments after my lab is done, so I don&rsquo;t have to
worry about them while I&rsquo;m working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I only put in comments so that I don&rsquo;t get marked down a bunch of
points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand what my professor means when they say that
they want good comments, so I just guess or throw in a bunch of
random stuff hoping it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I comment my code before I actually work on it because they give me
an outline for what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to put comments on repetitious code because the first
comments already explain what the rest of it is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code I wrote is so easy to understand anyone would get it, so I
don&rsquo;t really need any comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the end, what really matters is the fact that my program works,
so I don&rsquo;t see the point of putting in comments or making meaningful
variable names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My comments are a cry of help to whoever is grading my labs. (Ex. &ldquo;I
thought this section was working, but now it&rsquo;s not. Please give me
credit :,(&rdquo; )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I put comments above each method and call it good. This relieves me
from making a cumbersome method name and I don&rsquo;t need anything on
the inside of the method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put a comment saying that I wrote the file because I don&rsquo;t
need to, since I&rsquo;m the only one using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I comment my code so that I can practice for when I have a job and
other people are looking at my work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did any of the student programming behaviors resonate with you? How?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might you think differently about comments, variable names, and
user prompts based on this exercise?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the hallmarks of good comments?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider this.</strong> You are the manager of a software team. Some of your
team members are writing code without good variable names or comments.
One way to address the situation would be with a deontological approach.
Recall that the deontological ethical framework relies on a set of
rules. One such rule may be that &ldquo;variable names must be meaningful and
you just use comments at least every 5 lines in your code.&rdquo; How do you
think this would go over with the team member? (Probably be resistant at
being commanded to do something without a good reason)</p>
<p>Would there be a better way to approach the team member? Suggest a
method for approaching the team member using one of the other ethical
frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtue ethics: making a decision based on whether the outcome
upholds a set of virtues (honesty, compassion, patience, hard-work,
kindness are some examples)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analogies: making a decision based on a similar situation where the
ethicality of the similar situation was widely accepted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilitarianism: making a decision based on what is best for the
majority</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[Assessment (to be included on a later quiz or exam)]{.ul}</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some inhospitable practices when it comes to computer
programming? What is inhospitable about them?</li>
</ul>
<p>(poor user instructions, not indicating who wrote the code, meaningless
variable names, less readable code (pointers, &ldquo;clever&rdquo; algorithms), no
comments)</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you help someone come to see that inhospitable programming
practices are actually an ethical issue? Use one of the 4 ethical
frameworks (virtue ethics, deontology, analogies, utilitarianism) in
your answer.</li>

# Directions

Below are several scenarios.
Think about each of the following scenarios and determine how you
believe a virtuous person would respond. It might help to think about a
person, real or fictional, who you would consider to be highly moral and
decide how they might act. Then, try to determine which virtues
(character traits) would be most likely to influence them to act that
way.

# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Difficult assignment

A professor has made a new assignment that is more difficult for
students than she expected. She finds out by overhearing them
before class how much time they spent on it and how frustrated
they were. If she is a virtuous person, how should she respond?
What action should she take?

What virtues will guide her as she assesses and responds to this
situation?

## Scenario 2: Assignment deadline approaching

A student has a good friend who comes to him 1 hour before an assignment is due
asking for help. The student finds out that the friend has not actually started
the program yet. The professor has made it clear that submitted assignments are
to be a student’s own work. What does the virtuous student do?

What virtues will guide him as he assesses and responds to this
situation?

## Scenario 3: Office hours

A lab assistant is just about to finish his office hour. His
professor has told him that she can’t pay him for more than that
one hour. The lab assistant also has some assignments to finish up
for his own work. A student shows up with a syntax error that she
just can’t fix. What does the virtuous TA do?

What virtues will guide him as he assesses and responds to this
situation?

## Scenario 4: Too much homework

A professor has assigned way too much homework for several weeks in
a row. All of the students are complaining to each other about it.
What, if any, action should a virtuous student who is aware of
this situation take?

What virtues will guide her as she assesses and responds to this
situation?

# Student Materials

# Overview

**Ethics background** required: None

**Subject matter** referred to in this module: computer and data science
tasks

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

-   If the first year groundwork sequence is incorporated into a
    program, this lab should be assigned as homework after the “Why
    Ethics?” lab and prior to completing the Virtue Ethics lab in
    class

-   If other labs are being used as stand-alone labs, this is a good
    homework assignment to use to introduce students to the ethics
    frameworks prior to completing any other lab.

**Time** required:

* As homework: 25 minutes

**Learning objectives:**

-   Students are introduced to the 3 ethical frameworks that are
    considered in future modules

-   Students become familiar with virtue-terms

-   Students understand that virtues are characteristics that can be the
    basis for wise decisions

-   Students try to apply one or more frameworks to make a decision
    about an ethical dilemma.

-   Students have opportunities to practice thoughtfully articulating
    their convictions

**Ethical issue to be considered:** data visualization, accessibility

In a previous lab, ethics was defined as "the study of what it means to
'do the right thing'". The question then, is how do we know what is the
right thing? This lab introduces the 3 ethical frameworks used in future
labs. It begins to consider the virtue ethics framework at a very high
level along with introducing the use of the other frameworks.

**Flow**

-   Students are reminded of what "ethics" is

-   Students are introduced to the three ethical frameworks to be
    applied in future modules

-   Students are asked to reflect on someone who they believe is of high
    moral character

-   Students are asked how they believe their moral hero would respond
    to a situation based on their virtues.

-   Students consider the application of another ethical framework to
    the same situation.

**Preparation required:** 
* Read the entire module several times to become
familiar with the material. 
* Print or post the student homework assignment. 
* Consider questions that might be asked in class after the
students have completed the assignment. 

    Here are two possibilities:

    -   Describe your moral hero and their most significant virtue

    -   To which scenario did you respond, and which framework was the most
    helpful? Summarize your conclusion to the ethical dilemma based on
    that framework.

Student Homework Assignment

“Ethics is the study of what it means to ‘do the right thing.’” Sara
Basse, *A Gift of Fire*

But how do we know what is “the right thing”?

There are 3 approaches to determining the “right thing” often found in
ethics textbooks.

One is the **deontological approach** or framework. This framework is
based on a set of rules such as company rules, government rules, or
religious rules such as the Ten Commandments. If the action in question
adheres to the rules, it is considered to be the right thing to do in
that context.

Another common approach uses the **utilitarian framework**. There are
many varieties of this approach, but the basic idea is that the right
thing to do is the thing that brings the most utility, or happiness, to
the most people. While the action may help some and hurt others, if the
benefits to some outweigh the costs to others, the action is “the right
thing.”

The third framework, **virtue ethics**, takes a completely different
approach—it examines the background of our moral decisions and actions.
For example, it asks how a person who is generous will see a situation
and its moral demands differently than someone who is greedy. The “right
thing to do” is the thing that would be chosen by the virtuous person.

Virtue ethics is often the easiest framework to initially grasp. Most of
us have at least one person that we admire for making wise choices. This
assignment begins with thinking about ethics by considering the virtues
that that wise person might have to enable their wise decisions.

Moral Heroes Exercise

In her book, *Glittering Vices*, Rebecca DeYoung defines virtues as
“excellence of character, habits or dispositions of character that help
us live well as excellent human beings.” Using courage as an example of
a virtue, she explains, “A courageous friend stands up for us when our
reputation is unfairly maligned, despite the risk to his own personal or
professional reputation.”

In addition to generosity and courage, here are some commonly-listed
virtues:

Adaptability

Attentiveness

Authenticity

Commitment

Compassion

Contentment

Cooperation

Excellence

Faithfulness

Gratitude

Honesty

Hospitality

Humility

Inclusive

Integrity

Justice

Kindness

Loyalty

Mercy

Moderation

Open-mindedness

Patience

Perseverance

Professionalism

Provide for others

Quality

Reliability

Respect

Self-discipline

Service

Sustainability

Tact

In your own words, describe the meaning of “virtue”.

Who is the wisest, most virtuous, morally admirable person you know?
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   What virtues would you say characterize them?

Name at least 5-6 of them. (Use your own terms OR choose from the
virtue-term list above.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   Now try to rank those virtues in order of their importance. Does
    your hero have a “signature” or “defining” virtue that captures
    their overall character?

-   Can you tell a story that illustrates <u>why</u> this person is
    admirable or showcases what you mean by a particular
    virtue-attribution?

-   Respond to **one** of the following :

    1.  It is often said that the same data can be used to support a
        variety of conclusions. <u>Suppose your moral hero was a data
        analyst</u> who was asked to present data (using statistics,
        graphs, etc) in a way that supported a policy change that her
        company (and the analyst herself) thought would have a very
        positive impact on society. However, to do so, she would not
        be choosing what she truly believed was the most accurate
        presentation method. What would she do and why? (which
        virtue(s) previously ascribed to this individual would
        influence her decision?)

    2.  <u>Assume that your moral hero was a website designer</u>. He is
        asked to work on a website that allows people to get quick
        access to medical professionals for virtual appointments.
        Getting the site up and running in a timely fashion will make
        his company money more quickly, and give those who have
        trouble getting to a professional access more quickly.
        However, this would happen at the cost of not allowing time to
        determine how to make the site most accessible to people with
        visual impairments (differing levels of blindness including
        color blindness). Retrofitting the site later would be harder
        than doing it originally. Does the designer push for delaying
        the debut of the site or getting it out as quickly as possible
        and why? (which virtue(s) previously ascribed to this
        individual would influence his decision?)

-   Consider the descriptions of the other two ethics frameworks
    described in the introduction to the assignment. Do you think that
    one of them would work better than virtue ethics for deciding the
    scenarios you chose above? If so, state that framework and give a
    brief description of how you would apply it to make the decision.
    If not, explain why neither of the other frameworks would be
    helpful.

### Example

A computer hardware designer could create a new phone that was feature
rich but also designed to be obsolete within a year so that the user
would need to replace it quickly. This would allow for a significant
revenue stream for the company. However, the plethora of features could
be too complex for an elderly person to manage, and the planned
obsolescence could result in excessive waste.

On the flip-side, the designer could implement a version of the phone
where the initial setup included a choice of "essentials only" resulting
in a screen that was easy to navigate and included a large, clean,
display. There could be a prominent “help” button that connected the
user with a predetermined relative or caregiver. The phone could come
with an offer of a discount if the buyer’s previous phone was turned in
for recycling (materials reuse) or donation to a non-profit.

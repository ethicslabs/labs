# Student Materials

Worksheet:
-   [web version](core-values-worksheet/)
-   [Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrated-ethics/web/main/content/labs/core-values/core-values-worksheet.md)


# Overview

**Ethics background required:** None

This lab is designed to help students identify their values and how
choices may reflect those values.

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab: None

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

* Academic year: First semester of first year. Good first semester lab.

* Recommended previous labs: Why Ethics?

* Recommended follow-up labs: 
    * [*A first Look at Ethics in Computer and Data Science](/labs/first-look/) -- 
This lab is written to be homework, or 
    * [*Virtue Ethics*](/labs/virtue-ethics/)

**Time** required: 

* In class: 20 minutes
* Out of class: None (but this could be done out of class as well)


**Learning objectives**: 

-   Students identify their own values

-   Students recognize others may have different values

-   Students articulate a value and its application to decision making.


**Ethical dilemma or issue considered**

This is an introductory lab. The lab is designed for students to
reflect on their values, articulate what might influence a choice and
introduce the awareness that others may hold different values. The
discussion centers on how a future workplace is chosen (while not
really an ethical dilemma- this gives practice identifying the
connection between choice and personal values).

**Flow**

-   Students read what a value is.

-   Students select 20-25 values from a list of values.

-   Students choose values that might influence the choice of a future
    job.

-   Students share two of the values that would influence a job choice and why.
(This can be done in groups in class or facilitated using an online discussion
forum.)

-   Students reflect on how others' choices differed from their own.

**Preparation**

* Read the entire lab. 

* Print out enough copies of student handouts for the entire class. 

**Adaptations for using outside of class**

<!-- See online addendum. -->
* Students go through the same assignment on their own. 
* Students post their top two values that they have put W’s next to and describe
how those values would influence a job choice for them.
* Students need to read each other’s posts and discuss anything that surprised them.

**Side note on student interactions**

In this lab, students are asked to openly discuss their personal values.
To encourage authentic engagement with the material and each other, you
may need to state some guidelines on expectations of peer-to-peer
interaction. Here are two suggestions from 
"Guidelines For Classroom Interactions", the Center for Research on Learning & Teaching,
University of Michigan,
<http://crlt.umich.edu/examples-discussion-guidelines>

1.  **Understand that your words have effects on others.** Speak with
     care. If you learn that something you have said was experienced as
     disrespectful or marginalizing, listen carefully and try to
     understand that perspective. Learn how you can do better in the
     future.

2.  **Understand that others will come to these discussions with
     different experiences from yours.** Be careful about assumptions
     and generalizations you make based only on your experience. Be
     open to hearing and learning from other perspectives.

# Instructors Guide 

## Lesson plan 

### Introduction (to be read or summarized to class)

Your experience in college should help prepare you for your next steps
in life. That means that you will increase in knowledge. At this
university, we also are concerned that you learn to apply that knowledge
in a way that is beneficial to society. Sometimes it is hard to decide
what will be beneficial and what will not. To that end you will be
presented with opportunities to learn about ways to approach decision
making when faced with an ethical dilemma and to practice using those
approaches. This short exercise will ask us to think about what we value
and apply that knowledge to decision-making. In later labs, we will
learn about different frameworks for understanding societal values (aka
ethics) and practice using them in making ethical decisions.

### Activity

-   Distribute the values handout to students.

-   Instruct students to read the definition of what a value is. Ask one
    or more students to define “value” in their own words. (3 minutes)

-   Instruct students to circle their top 20-25 values from the list of
    values provided (3 minutes)

-   When most students are finished (2-3 minutes), instruct students to
    put a W next to the circled values that might inform where they
    would choose to work when they graduate.

-   When most students are finished (1-2 minutes), instruct students to
    form groups of 3-6. Ask each student to share with their group 1-2
    of their values labelled with a W and why that value would
    influence their work choice. Provide an example. An example might
    be that flexibility is important so that students might not want
    to work for a company that requires strict start and finish times.

### Reflection (to be completed in class)

Ask each group to report to what degree answers differed within the
group. (2-5 minutes)

Ask several students to share with the class an answer provided by a
groupmate that surprised them or caused them to reconsider what values
might be important in choosing a future workplace. (2-5 minutes)

Ask students if they can think of an example where it would be important
to understand the values of others. One example might be if a person on
a team valued punctuality and the team meetings always started late.
That could cause irritation on the part of the punctual team member.
(2-5 minutes)

### Assessment 

-   What is a value?

    -   Students will probably refer to one of the definitions given on
        the handout.

-   Why is it important to understand what we value?

    -   Understanding what we value can help in deciding between choices.

-   Why is it important to understand what others value?

    -   Understanding what others value can help make teams more
        cohesive, help make products better, demonstrate respect, etc.

-   Give an example of a choice in your life that reflects one (or more)
    of your values.

### Addendum if using the outside of class

#### Some additional questions

These questions can be added to the ones on the worksheet.
Use of an electonic discussion board can facilitate students 
seeing and responding to other students' responses.

4. Post two of the values you placed a W by and write two
sentences about how those values would influence a job choice for you.

5. Read the posts from other students in the class. Find a
post that is similar to your values. Find a second post that is
different from your values. State how they are different and similar.
Does either post surprise you? Why or why not?

6. Consider the two posts you cited in question 5. If
you worked with an individual with a post similar to yours, what might
be the benefits of working with this person? What could be the deficits?

    If you worked with the individual with the post different to yours, what
might be the benefits of working with this person? What could be the
deficits?

If your course is a blended format, you could follow up in class with
question 6 as a small group discussion.

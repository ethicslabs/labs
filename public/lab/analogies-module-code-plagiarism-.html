<p><u>Ethical issue to be considered</u>: professional ethics, intellectual
property, plagiarism</p>
<p>This module introduces a new tool for grasping the ethicality of a new
area that is similar to more well-understood predicaments. Since
computer science and data science are still new areas of work and study,
analogies to older disciplines can be helpful. It is not a commonly
accepted “ethical framework.”</p>

<p><strong>Lesson plan</strong></p>
<p><u>Introduction</u> (to be read or summarized to class)</p>
<p>At this point you may have seen several ethical frameworks that can help
make decisions regarding the morally right course of action.
Possibilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Virtue ethics</strong>: Makes the choice by using the question “what would
the virtuous person do?”</p>
<p><strong>Deontology</strong>: Makes the choice by determining if the action adheres to
a set of rules related to the context of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Utilitarianism:</strong> Makes the choice by determining if the benefits of
the action outweigh the costs of the action.</p>
<p>Sometimes, before any of these frameworks can be used, it is helpful to
just understand the situation better. The computer and data science
fields are new enough and dynamic enough that there is limited or no
precedence for dealing with a particular situation. This is where an
analogy can be helpful.</p>
<p>An analogy is saying something is like something else for the purpose of
clarification. Generally the concept in the analogy is better understood
than the dilemma in question, and might help in understanding the
less-familiar predicament. </p>
<p>A frequent example from computing is using an analogy to understand the
ethicality of hacking into a person’s computer, just to look around. Is
this OK if the hacker makes no changes and steals no data? Most people
have an opinion on this action now, but it was confusing when it was
first occurring. The analogy commonly used has nothing to do with
computing, but can share the concepts of looking around but not
stealing. This analogy would be a person breaking into another person’s
house and looking around, but not damaging or stealing anything. The
concept of breaking and entering in the context of the home had been
defined by society as unethical. Probably, then, entering someone else’s
computer would also be unethical.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that analogies are imperfect. There is generally a point
where the comparison no longer holds. In the case of “looking around the
house” while the perpetrator may gain knowledge about the layout, for
example, if the person doesn’t actually take something, no theft
occurred. However, in looking around a computer, it is easy to steal
without even doing a copy/paste. Furthermore, stealing data can cause
future extensive damage while stealing jewelry is an end in itself.</p>
<p><u>Activity</u></p>
<p>We are going to try to gain some insight into ethically writing computer
programs by comparing them to writing essays. Most students have written
many essays in their lives, but writing computer programs is not as
familiar. Work through the exercise with your group, and then we will
come back together do discuss where the analogy worked, and where it did
not</p>

<p>Where the analogy breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The order of statements in a computer program must be somewhat
predictably sequential in order to run. The order of information in
an essay could vary significantly.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer programs either run or they don’t. An essay can be
acceptable even though it is not excellent. Less middle ground on
programs. You can’t test an essay to see if it is correct</p></li>
<li><p>Go through each type of writing plagiarism and try to determine if
it fits. Here are some ideas, but should hear from students first.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Complete plagiarism:</strong> copying an entire program</p>
<p><strong>Source-based:</strong> not clearly analogous</p>
<p><strong>Direct:</strong> perhaps getting pieces of a solution to a program from
various people and putting it together as your own</p>
<p><strong>Self:</strong> This more applies to publishing. Probably not an issue if
it’s not represented as brand new material</p>
<p><strong>Paraphrasing</strong>: Changing variable names and turning it in as your
own</p>
<p><strong>Inaccurate authorship:</strong> someone else wrote the program for you even
though it was new, or, you gave a program that you had written to
someone (both people culpable)</p>
<p><strong>Mosaic:</strong> Parts of the program are yours, and parts someone elses.
This can be an interesting discussion about copying snippets from a
book.</p>
<p><strong>Accidental</strong>: Someone did not understand that what they were doing
was plagiarism. (they thought they were making their code unique by
re-ordering or changing variable names)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Have students discuss how helpful this analogy was in increasing
understanding of what is ethical to do in the process of writing a
computer program as a student. Note that things might be slightly
different in industry as code re-used might the property of the
company. Re-use of your or other’s code in that context might not be
plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Assessment</u> (to be included at a later date on a quiz, paper, or
exam to determine if learning objectives were reached)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is an analogy?</p></li>
<li><p>For what are analogies useful?</p></li>
<li><p>Provide students with a scenario and ask them to identify the
ethical dilemma along with a non-technical analogy that helps to
clarify the situation. Example: Game company X is frequently coming
out with new versions of their game to keep their income stream
constant which allows them to reliably meet payroll. However,
constant releases encourage teens to spend more time on the game and
to crave the latest and greatest. What is the ethical dilemma, what
is a non-tech analogy that might shed light on how to handle that
dilemma?</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Students might see addiction to food, drugs, tobacco, or alcohol as
a parallel. They may decide that a solution would be a warning on
the game (analogous to calorie disclosures for food), creating games
that are less addictive, raising the price of the game (analogous to
tobacco taxes) to support the income stream instead of frequent
releases.</p></li>
<li><p>Care should be paid when making use of an analogy. What problems can
&gt; arise with analogies?</p>
<ul>
<li>trying to force one that doesn’t really work and drawing wrong
conclusions from it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional help on analogies for professor</strong></p>
<p>We use analogies to compare two things that have similarities. Often,
the student is more familiar with the analogous object or idea, so it
can help us reason about the more unknown counterpart. See the
introduction for an extended description and example, or see the links
below for more examples of analogies being used. Links accessed 6/2019</p>

<p>Can you think of distinct ways that programs and essays differ? (where
the analogy breaks down?)</p>
<p>The ethical issue of plagiarism is fairly common in the realm of essay
writing but not as easily understood in computer programming. Below you
will find a list of the types of plagiarism found in writing. Consider
each and see if it could be applied to help understand how plagiarism in
programming might be better understood.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Complete plagiarism is the most severe form of plagiarism where a
researcher takes a manuscript or study that someone else created, and
submits it under his or her name. It is tantamount to intellectual theft
and stealing.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Source-based Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Plagiarism may occur because of the different types of sources. For
example, when a researcher references a source that is incorrect or does
not exist, it is a misleading citation. Plagiarism also occurs when a
researcher uses a secondary source of data or information, but only
cites the primary source of information. Both these types lead to an
increase in the number of references sources. This, in turn, increases
the citation number of the references.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Direct Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Direct or verbatim plagiarism occurs when an author copies the text of
another author, word for word, without the use of quotation marks or
attribution, thus passing it as his or her own. In that way, it is like
complete plagiarism, but it refers to sections (rather than all) of
another paper.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Self or Auto Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Auto-plagiarism, also known as self-plagiarism or duplication, happens
when an author reuses significant portions of his or her previously
published work without attribution.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Paraphrasing plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>This is, as published on Wiley, the most common type of plagiarism. It
involves the use of someone else’s writing with some minor changes in
the sentences and using it as one’s own. Even if the words differ, the
original idea remains the same and plagiarism occurs.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Inaccurate Authorship</strong></p>
<p>Inaccurate authorship or misleading attribution can happen in two ways:</p>
<p>In one form, when an individual contributes to a manuscript but does not
get credit for it. The second form is the opposite: when an individual
gets credit without contributing to the work. This type of plagiarism,
whichever way it occurs, is a violation of the code of conduct in
research.</p>
<p>It is also possible to commit this form of plagiarism when someone else
edits a manuscript, leading to substantive changes. In this case, the
recommendation is to acknowledge the contributors at the time of
publication, even if they are not listed as authors.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Mosaic Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Mosaic plagiarism may be more difficult to detect because it interlays
someone else’s phrases or text within its own research. It is also known
as patchwork plagiarism and it is intentional and dishonest.</p>
<p>Application to computer programming?</p>
<p><strong>Accidental Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Whether intended or unintended, there is no excuse for plagiarism and
the consequences are often the same. However, plagiarism may be
accidental if it occurred because of neglect, mistake, or unintentional
paraphrasing.</p>

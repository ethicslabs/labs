If a piece of software is considered to be “open source”, it means that
anyone has access to the actual code and can change it for their
purposes. In general, the software is free to use, but a price may be
paid for support. Linux is one of the most common examples of open
source software. Proprietary software is software like Microsoft Windows
or your favorite computer game where you are only provided with the
executable binary and have no access to the code.

One of the main benefits of open source software is that it is free.
There are other benefits as well, along with drawbacks. Your job is to
**find 3 credible articles** on the advantages and disadvantages of open
source software vs. proprietary software. Pros and cons of both must be
represented across the three articles. If you have discussed media
literacy, you will recall that credible articles have the following
properties:

1.  The **author** is well known or his/her credentials are strong and easy to find,
    or the organization represented on the webpage is known and reputable.

2.  The **purpose** of the article is mainly information, not to sell a
    product or push an opinion – some credible articles may be mostly
    one-sided but acknowledge another side and are not intended to be
    the sole article used

3.  The **timeliness** of the article is appropriate to the discipline (a
    literature or history article that is dated may be fine, but a
    computer science or political science article that addresses current
    technology or the current state of the political climate should not
    be).

4.  The article/post itself **references** credible authors using same
    criteria presented above.

Another important consideration

5.  The article or post is **one of several** diverse articles or posts that
    you use to gather information.

List each article found below. Use at least three criteria from the list
above that are true about the article to support its credibility. List
the pros and cons that the article reveals about open source software.
This completed document should be uploaded prior to the next class
meeting and **should include at least 5 different pros and 5 different
cons across the articles (not each).**

For each article provide the following information

* Title and author/organization
* URL
* Credibility points (list things that make the article credible)
* Pros/Cons of open soucrce software listed in the article.

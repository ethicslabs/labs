# Overview

**Ethics background** required: It is helpful if students are familiar
with the utilitarian and virtue ethics methods of considering ethical
dilemmas. They should understand what stakeholders are. For any who
need it, there are brief reviews of these concepts in the assignment. It
is suggested that the Media Literacy Lab be completed prior to this
lab, but principles of finding credible articles are reviewed in the
student homework handout.

**Subject matter** referred to in this Lab: Linux or other open source
software.

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

* Academic year: Year 2-4 core course that uses open source
software (OS works if students use Linux)

* Recommended previous labs: Foundational labs and media literacy lab

* Recommended follow-up labs: No direct follow-up lab

**Time** required: 

* In class: 20-30 minutes;
* Out of class: 30 minutes

**Learning objectives**:

-   Students apply what they know about media literacy to finding
    articles on open source software

-   Understand the terms “open source” and “proprietary” and consider
    the benefits of each

-   Expand student’s knowledge in the area of the ethical issue of
    accessibility

-   Evaluate the accessibility of open source software using the
    utilitarian and virtue ethics frameworks

-   Practice articulating and supporting a view about using open source
    software in light of accessibility issues

-   Students have the opportunity to find a creative, ethical solution
    to creating accessible software


<u>Ethical issues to be considered</u>: Accessibility, Media Literacy

This lab requires students to complete some homework outside of class.
They will be finding credible articles that consider the pros and cons
of open source software and posting summaries online prior to class.
During class they will be discussing within groups how open source and
proprietary software measure up in regard to accessibility (economic,
mental, and physical).

**Preparation**: Read the entire lab. Post the homework assignment
online (or print on papers if you would like to have the assignment
completed off-line. Print the group discussion questions either one per
group or one per student.

# Flow

-   For homework, students find and read three articles from
    *credible* sources describing the pros and cons of open
    source software vs. proprietary. Results of this research should
    be posted online or submitted prior to the classwork part of this
    lab. [Find student instructions here](open-source-accessibility-worksheet/)

-   In class, the instructor introduces the idea of accessibility. The
    class brainstorms together on the different types of disabilities
    and what accommodations might be required in software products to
    address them.

-   Students work in groups considering questions on the accessibility
    handout

-   Students complete an exercise that shows that the virtue ethics
    framework doesn’t clarify the accessible software dilemma, and
    that the utilitarian framework might be better.

# Guide for Instructors 

## Lesson plan

### Introduction (to be read or summarized to class) (5 min)


Ask students: "In your own words, what is open source software?"
*(definition is on handout)*

One of the strongest arguments for open source software is that it is
free, making it economically accessible to most people. In this
discussion, we will consider other aspects of accessibility with regard
to open source software. Accessibility is one of the current ethical
considerations that software engineers must take into account as they
design new software.


The Oxford Dictionary defines accessibility as: 
> "The quality of being able to be reached or entered."

It further explains accessibility as

> 1.1 The quality of being easy to obtain or use.
'students were concerned about the accessibility of quality academic
counselling'.

> 1.2 The quality of being easily understood or appreciated.
'the accessibility of his work helped to popularize modern art'

> 1.3 The quality of being easily reached, entered, or used by people who
have a disability.
'many architects believe that accommodating wheelchairs is all there is
to providing accessibility'.

Have students brainstorm on the disabilities (learning, mental,
emotional, physical) that people have to deal with today. Then ask them
to come up with reasonable accommodations that software engineers might
be able to include to help with these issues. The chart below provides
the instructor with some ideas. There are many more.

## Activity (10 min)

Students evaluate open source and proprietary software
with regard to accessibility (10 min)

* Divide students into groups of 3-5 and pass out the student group
discussion handouts. Students are asked to answer some questions based
on their reading homework.

* If students are struggling, here are some potential answers to the
questions:

    * Is open source software easy to obtain and use?

        * It is easy to obtain in that it is free.

        * Sometimes the software downloading instructions might not be as
    clear as they are for proprietary software that has a whole team
    writing the manuals

        * Are there more bugs in open source software? Debatable. With more
    eyes on it there are more people to find and correct bugs.
    Proprietary software might have rushed deadlines so testing is not
    as thorough as desired. On the other hand proprietary software
    should have a testing team along with a documents team and a
    helpdesk.

        * Is open source easy to use? Also debatable. Again, no helpdesk for
    free versions, but lots of open forums.

        * A user would have to consider if the software would run on the
    user’s current operating system, or if a virtual machine would be
    required?

        * Open source is not locked into a particular vendor’s platform so it
    is often usable by more people.

        * Your students should have other thoughts from their reading.


    * Is open source software easily understood?

        * Is the interface good?

        * Are there sufficient manuals? If the user wants to configure or
    change the code is the documentation (comments in code) good?

        * Since many people are touching the code, have they kept the
    documentation current? This is probably more likely to happen with
    proprietary software, but again, those open forums are
    invaluable!


    * Is open source software easy to access by people with disabilities? Be
sure to think about all of the different disabilities that you discussed
with your class.

        *Disabilities can be physical (visual, auditory, motor), mental, or
    cognitive (learning disabilities).

        * Proprietary software designers may be more likely to include
    features like interfaces with attention to color-blindness, voice
    recognition, or audible readings of software.

        * Since open source software has more people looking at it, the
    diversity might allow for people who are sensitive to less common
    disabilities to make unique changes.

        * Open source was created to meet the needs of the original author,
    so might not, at least initially be very robust.

## Reflection as a class

Ask students what the problem is with an ethical analysis using virtue
ethics (both approaches – proprietary and open source violate various
virtues). Ask students to suggest some of the virtues violated.

* Virtue ethics analysis (students may arrive at either answer using
virtue ethics – the idea is to get them to think! ) Some of the virtues
that might be violated with proprietary are generosity and transparency.
With open source, quality and hospitality (bad documentation) could be
issues.

* In trying to come up with a Utilitarian solution (helpful to the most
people) students may come up with hybrid solutions such as the
following:

    * Basic software is open source, but customers can pay for customized
    accessibility features.

    * Large companies support programmers in open source projects as
    add-ons to proprietary projects.

    * Software is free, but training and documentation cost.

    * Open source project display advertisements.

## Assessment 

Ask students if the discussion changed the way that they look at open
source or proprietary software

Ask students what they learned about designing software with an eye for
accessibility

Ask students to provide 2 accessibility issues with open source software

Ask students to provide 2 accessibility issues with proprietary software

Ask if virtue ethics or utilitarianism was a better framework for
considering this ethical dilemma and why

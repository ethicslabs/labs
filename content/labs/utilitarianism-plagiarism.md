# Student Matrials

* [web page](utilitarianism-plagiarism-worksheet/)
* [Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrated-ethics/web/main/content/labs/utilitarianism-plagiarism/utilitarianism-worksheet.md)

# Overview

**Ethics background** required: Familiarity with Virtue Ethics and
Deontological frameworks are needed.

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab: plagiarism in a mathematics
course

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

* Academic year: First year, second semester, probably in second
semester programming or mathematics.

* Recommended previous labs: Virtue Ethics and Introduction to Deontology
Framework Using AI

* Recommended follow-up labs: Analogies: Plagiarism Example

**Time** required:

* Out of class: If you choose to review Virtue and Deontology frameworks out
of class: 15-20 min.

* In class: 25 mins or if everything is covered in class: 30-45 min.

**Learning objectives**:

-   Introduce and apply utilitarian ethics framework

-   Learn to recognize stakeholders and what they might value

-   Practice articulating conclusions regarding ethical dilemmas

-   Review virtue ethics and deontology frameworks

**Ethical dilemma or issue to be considered**: professional ethics,
intellectual property

The ethical dilemma here continues to be "what constitutes plagiarism?"
This lab will consider the use of paid homework solutions in light of
the different ethical frameworks discussed so far.

**Preparation required:**

* Read the entire lab several times..

* Make pre-discussion material available either online or on paper.

* Print a copy of the student handout for each student in the class or
provide access to a document posted online. 

* Have a copy of the instructor's "answers" available in case you need them.

**Flow**

If you choose to have students review outside of class

-   Students review both virtue and deontological frameworks. This can
    be done by online discussion, on paper or “quiz”- whatever format
    works best in your class.

-   Students answer questions on what are the possible pros and cons of
    the two frameworks.

In class part

-   Introduce utilitarianism and define stakeholders.

-   Discuss at least one of the scenarios (or use your own) in light of
    utilitarianism.

-   Break students up into small groups, have each group discuss the
     first scenario in light of the utilitarianism framework. Then as a
     class discussion the different solutions groups found using
     utilitarianism. This is a good time to check the students'
     understanding of the framework.

-   Next, assign each group a framework to use to examine the second
    plagiarism scenario.

-   As a class, reflect on the helpfulness or challenges of the various
    frameworks. A suggestion- if the instructor chooses to, now is a
    good time to discuss homework expectations and the use of
    solutions in the class.

# Guide for Instructors 

## Lesson plan

### Pre-discussion assignment 

*Note: This can also be done along with the rest of the lab in class.* 

-   Have students review virtue and deontological frameworks as
    homework or in some other way before or during class discussion.

* Key elements of review:

    -   **Ethics** is the study of determining the **right thing to do** (in a moral
    sense).
    
    - There are multiple frameworks from which to determine what it means
    to "do the right thing". We focus primarily on **virtue ethics**,
    the **deontological framework**, and **utilitarianism**.

#### Virtue Ethics

-   **Virtue ethics** is an ethical framework that helps us evaluate a
    solution to an ethical dilemma by seeing if it conflicts with any
    of our moral values. The virtue ethics framework asks the question
    "what would a virtuous person do" to determine what is right. A
    virtuous person, according to Aristotle, would have good
    underlying character traits that would cause them to make good
    choices. The main benefit of this framework is that it is very
    flexible. It can be applied to a wide variety of decisions.

What are some of the challenges of using the virtue ethics framework?
(Let students answer, but here are 2 obvious problems)

-   Finding a truly virtuous person to make decisions

-   Some virtues may appear to be in conflict with each other (kindness
    and honesty, for example), making the decision less obvious. (How
    to answer someone who asks what you think of the book that they
    wrote – when you don’t like it)

Could use the follow questions as ethical tests based on the virtue ethics framework:

-   Does this decision agree or disagree with my moral values? \[5\]

-   Are any of my virtues in conflict with each other because of this
    dilemma?

-   Think of someone whose moral judgement you respect, would this
    decision line up with his or her values? \[5\]

-   Would a child or your parental figure be proud of your decision?
    \[5\]

-   Is this decision in line with my company’s core values? \[1\]

#### Deontological Framework

Deontological framework is built on a set of **rules or principles**. The
deontological ethics framework asks the question “does this decision
break any of the rules or laws” to determine what is right. The main
benefit of this framework is that it is more rigid and avoids some of
the subjectivity of other frameworks.

What are some of the challenges of using the deontological framework? 
(Let students answer, but here are three possible answers)

-   Can create a paradox. For example- the rule should not harm another
    person, however what if harming another person saves others lives?

-   People may follow different sets of rules. (Think about speed
    limits, seat belt laws, smoking laws, etc.)

-   No focus on consequences of an action, just if it follows the
    "rule".

Could use the follow questions as ethical tests based on the framework:

-   Does this decision break any laws? \[1\]

-   Would I be going against any codes of ethics?

-   What would my profession's governing body think of this decision?

-   Does my decision go against any implied, unspoken moral laws?

-   If I am setting a standard, would I want it to be followed by other
    people (including my competitors)?

#### Groups

When we used each of these frameworks, the evaluation was
completed by an individual or a small group. Often, a dilemma must be
decided for a larger population or the decision may impact a larger
group -- including some not involved in the decision process. 
An individual, may disagree with a certain societal belief (or
value), but still follow the related rule or decision so that the society will
function as well as possible. 

<!-- **Ethics are actually a set of rules or beliefs that govern a larger group such as a company or culture**. -->


#### Utilitarianism

The next ethical framework that we will
consider, utilitarianism, is useful for considering ethical dilemmas
that affect a large group of people.

## Activity (To be completed in class)

1. **Introduce the concepts of utilitarianism and stakeholders**:
    (read/summarized by instructor)

    To evaluate a dilemma employing utilitarian ethics, one would look at
which solution produces the most amount of utility, which can be
measured by happiness, good, benefits, etc. to the stakeholders.
*Stakeholders* are all the parties or individuals that would be
affected by the decision. A common example in this age of autonomous
vehicles considers whether, if the dilemma arose, a vehicle should be
programmed to hit a school bus or a single car. The stakeholders would
definitely be those in both vehicles, but also could be extended
family, the car manufacturer, the members of the school that the
school bus serves etc. The greater good (or lesser evil) would
probably be to hit the single car because it would affect fewer
people.

    Here is another example that involves a doctor and several patients.
There are five ill patients in a hospital who desperately need organ
transplants; however, there are no available organs. By chance, a
healthy traveler comes in for a check-up and happens to be a match for
each of the five patients. Assuming that there would be no legal
repercussions, the doctor could kill the traveler and use his organs
to save the 5 lives. The stakeholders would be each of the patients
and their families. From a strictly utilitarian perspective, the right
thing to do could be to kill the one healthy person in order to save
the five, because this option brings about the greatest utility (or
happiness) despite causing instrumental harm. You can see that
utilitarianism also needs to be used cautiously!

2. Review with the students this set of 
**questions that could be used to evaluate a solution using utilitarianism**.

    -   Who will be affected by this decision? (who are the
        stakeholders?)

    -   Who benefits from this decision?

    -   Who will be harmed by this decision?

    -   Do the benefits outweigh the harms?

    -   What are all the long-term and short-term consequences? \[1\]

    -   Does this option do less harm than the alternatives? \[2\]

3.  **Ask students about another scenario to ensure they understand utilitarianism**
   before moving forward. 
   
    One example would be this:
    Imagine that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency gets wind of a
    plot to set off a dirty bomb in a major American city. Agents
    capture a suspect who, they believe, has information about where
    the bomb is planted. Is it permissible for them to torture the
    suspect into revealing the bomb's whereabouts?

    * Students should recognize that the stakeholders are the CIA, the
bomber, and the city members. From a utilitarian perspective, students
should conclude that yes, this is permissible, because it would result
in maximum good (the safety of everyone) despite causing instrumental
harm to one person. You should mention that there could be other
solutions that bring more happiness.  \[3\]

    A less violent example would be a family of 10 where most members
really want a dog. One member of the family is allergic to dogs. One
member of the family believes that he/she will have the burden of
responsibility for the dog and doesn’t know if he/she can handle it.
Who are the stakeholders? From a utilitarian perspective, should the
family get the dog?

    * Students should recognize the stakeholders as the family members
and potentially the dog. A utilitarian evaluation would be to get the
dog, but perhaps make a plan to divide the work and get allergy shots
for the allergic family member.

4.  **Have students get into groups to complete the activity and pass
    out the [student handout](utilitarianism-plagiarism-worksheet/).** 
<!--    (The size of the groups will depend on
    the class size, and the instructor can determine if (s)he wants the
    student-created or teacher-created groups).  -->
    
5. Ask the students to answer **question 1.**

    * Ask students to discuss in their groups how to complete the assignment
in a way that brings about the most happiness for the most people.

    *  Note that happiness might be from being able to do no work (so the
    work goes on one person while the rest can relax) or it can
    involve getting the best grade (so they all work together, or one
    group in the classroom does the work and everyone gets credit for
    it, etc.) Differnt stakeholders may define happiness differently.

6. **Have students share their answers** and their rationale with the
    rest of the class.

7.  **Assign different frameworks to different groups** (virtues,
    deontology, and utilitarianism) and ask them to complete
    **question 2** using their assigned framework. 
    
    Have them argue whether the solutions given are
    ethical or not according to their assigned ethical framework.
    Discuss the value of using multiple ethical frameworks to evaluate
    a solution to an ethical dilemma.

## Reflection (to be completed as homework if desired)

Possible reflection questions

1. According to what was said in class, how are ethics different from
personal values?

    - Possible answer: Ethics are rules or beliefs that are created
      based on societal values. Individual persons may have
      conflicts with them but they help in making a society function
      smoothly

2. Why is it helpful to consider multiple ethical frameworks when faced
with an ethical dilemma?

    - Possible answer: Sometimes different frameworks encourage
        different solutions or sometimes a particular framework is
        more helpful than another. Multiple frameworks help us think
        more robustly about the issue at hand.

## Assessment 

To test students’ understanding of utilitarianism, present a scenario
and have them analyze it through utilitarian ethics. You can make your 
own example, or use one like this:

> A company can send an advertising email to millions of recipients.
Approximately 1 in 100,000 people buy the product in response to this
email, but the company still makes a profit. Evaluate, from a
utilitarian perspective, whether it is right or wrong to send spam
emails. Be sure to include the stakeholders as well as the positive and
negative effects on utility for each party.

-   Possible Answer: The stakeholders would be the people receiving the
    email, including those who buy the product and those who do not,
    the mail handlers, and the company. The small percentage of people
    who do buy the product gain utility (from obtaining the product)
    and so does the company (from their profit). The majority of
    people who do not buy the product and are only annoyed at the spam
    lose utility. Because this group far outweighs the group of people
    who gain utility, the aggregate utility is decreased and thus it
    is unethical, from a utilitarian perspective, to send spam emails.

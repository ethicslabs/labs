## The Case

Consider the following courtroom witness scenarios for a case where a
jury is attempting to reach a verdict in a wrongful death case. The

why.

patient's rabbi, the patient's cousin, the hospital's HR director, the
hospital's nighttime security guard, the hospital's PR director.

**Set 2**: There are three witnesses: the attending physician, the patient's
sister (a nurse) who was a frequent visitor and kept detailed notes, and
an outside expert agreed upon by both the hospital's lawyer and the

the patient's injury hired by the family's law team

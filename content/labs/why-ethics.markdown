# Student Materials

-   [web version](why-ethics-worksheet/)
-   [Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integrated-ethics/web/main/content/labs/virtue-ethics/why-ethics-worksheet.md)

# Overview

**Ethics background** required: None. This lab motivates the need for
ethics education in computer science and/or data science.

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab: What do computer
scientists/data scientists do?

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

-   Ideally, this is the first semester of the freshman year. We
    recommend that the students are 3-4 weeks into the first semester
    when this lab is administered.

-   Recommended previous labs: None

-   Recommended follow-up labs: *Virtue Ethics*, but any lab can follow

**Time** required:

-   Out of class: none
-   In class: 25 minutes

**Learning objectives**:

-   Students gain a better understanding of how computer scientists
    and/or data scientists contribute to the world.

-   Students have the opportunity to think about the responsibility that
    rests on their shoulders should they pursue a career in computer
    and/or data science.

-   Students see the need for ethics education in computer and/or data
    science.

-   Students understand what the study of ethics is

**Ethical issues to be considered:**  This lab briefly considers many
ethical issues in computing and data science. The actual issues covered
will depend on the professor and class contributions.

**Flow**

-   Students are introduced to the variety of contributions that
    Computer and Data Scientists make to the world.

-   Student groups consider what could go wrong in the areas of Data and
    Computer Science that they just learned about.

-   Student groups consider the good that could be done with products
    and analysis done in the best way.

-   Ethics as a field of study is defined.

-   Explanation that future labs will help provide tools for and give
    students practice in recognizing and making decisions about
    potential ethical issues that they could encounter in their future
    work.

**Preparation:** Read through the entire lab. Make copies of the job
descriptions for computer and data scientists. Alternatively, make the
descriptions available online.

# Guide for Instructors

## Lesson plan

### Introduction (10 min)

Hand out (or point students to) the list below of jobs that computer and
data scientists might be hired to do. Give them a moment to look it
over, and ask if they would like to add anything.

#### Computer Science

-   Software developer

    -   Games

    -   Social media

    -   Airplane/Car navigation systems

    -   Predictive algorithms (who is a good candidate for a loan or
        job, predicting future weather or erosion patterns, predicting
        if a person who is arrested is a flight risk)

    -   Science applications (finding genetically-related diseases,
        analyzing tumor progression/reduction, drug discovery)

    -   Compilers/operating systems

<!-- -->

-   Database Administrator

    -   Design systems to store and retrieve information

-   Computer hardware engineer

    -   Design the next phone, computer or tablet

    -   Create/test circuit boards, routers, memory devices

    -   Create ways for disabled to move and/or communicate

-   Information security analyst

    -   Detect cyber attacks

    -   Prevent cyber attacks

-   Web Developer

    -   Create the technical structure for websites 

    -   Make sure that web pages are accessible and easily downloadable 

    -   Structure sites to maximize the number of page views and
        visitors through search engine optimization.

#### Data Science

-   Data Analytics

    -   Help develop strategies to make better business decisions

    -   Create/use programs to help individuals invest money

    -   Track and analyze website usage patterns

<!-- -->

-   Data architect

    -   Find, clean and organize data

    -   Look for patterns in data collected

-   Machine learning

    -   Develop predictive algorithms based on what has happened in the
        past (medicine, business, job/student success, economy,
        climate change, disease spread etc.)

-   Statistician

    -   Interpret, analyze, and report statistical information (could be
        related to research in any field: business, psychology,
        sociology, medicine..)

### Activity (15 min)

**Read or summarize to students:** It should be apparent from the list
that computer and data scientists can hold jobs that are very
influential in society. With such power, people in these positions can
bring great good, or, if they are not careful, great harm. In the next
10 minutes do the following in your group:

-   Choose a note-taker and spokesperson so that your ideas can be
    shared with the larger group.

-   Brainstorm with your group things that could go wrong in any of
    these areas if they are not handled carefully.

-   Brainstorm with your group the things that could be beneficial to
    society if they were handled in the best possible way.

### Reflection as a class (10 min)

After 10 minutes, return the students to the larger group to share their
thoughts. See if an individual can summarize the need to consider
carefully how products are designed and data analyzed based on the class
discussion.

Here are some ideas if the students are unable to come up with enough ideas:

Things that can go wrong:

-   Games can be violent and/or addictive

-   Social media can also be addictive and also divisive. It can
    propagate wrong ideas and bullying, can enable predators, and may
    trivialize or commoditize relationships.

-   Security specialists could use their training for wrong purposes.

-   Hardware engineers could produce too much e-waste and/or use too
    much energy.

-   Statisticians could skew results to force desired outcomes.

-   Data architects could clean data in a way that eliminates diversity
    from the data.

-   Web designers can embed software to collect unauthorized data.

Things that can make a positive difference:

-   Games can build friendships and provide opportunities to relax and
    de-stress

-   Social media can keep people in touch with each other

-   Security specialists can protect privacy

-   Hardware engineers can provide devices that help the physically
    challenged and elderly to be more secure, productive, and
    connected.

-   Statisticians could interpret data is a way that helps make informed
    decisions on healthcare or other policy

-   Web designers could create portals for information with
    accessibility features that improve the lives of many.

### Wrap up (Read or give to students)

According to author Sara Baase, in her book *A Gift of Fire* ([Baase 2012](#ref-Baase:2012)), **“Ethics
is the study of what it means to do the right thing.”** While this is a
simple definition, it turns out that the study of ethics can be a
complex topic. However, it is certainly one that computer and data
scientists, because of the nature of their work, need to carefully
consider as they are trained and then move forward into their careers.

If your university has a plan to use future labs, mention that students
will have opportunities in other classes to learn tools to help them as
computer/data scientists make ethical decisions on implementations and
to anticipate detrimental outcomes.

### Assessment

<!-- (to be included later on a quiz, paper, or exam to determine if LOs were reached) -->

1.  Name 3 jobs that you as a computer or data scientist could hold in
    the future

2.  What is ethics?

3.  Give an example of a product design or a data analysis task that
    could be have positive effects or negative effects on its users
    depending on how the data scientist, computer scientist, or
    engineer approached the implementation.

### Online teaching

This lesson is easily adapted to an asynchronous online environment
where a student would complete the assignment individually and then post
some of their ideas while also responding to the ideas of others.

Web accessibility is something that Ian Macrae struggles with every day. As
someone with a visual impairment, he uses VoiceOver software. "I use Amazon
every day to find Kindle Daily Deals. To do that I have to go through every
heading before I reach what I want, then I have to go through each element
within that heading to get to the list of books. The whole process of navigating
a website is a long and complicated process," he says.

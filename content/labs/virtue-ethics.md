# Guide for Instructors 

## Lesson plan

### Introduction (to be read or summarized to class) (3 minutes)

Virtues can be defined as character traits -- qualities that impact how we
feel, think, and act --that we can cultivate through intentional practice,
and that in turn shape our practice and action. Virtues are good
character traits. We might usefully distinguish virtues -- moral
qualities of a person -- from personality traits that are not specifically
moral. For example, being an optimistic person or an extrovert, or
having leadership qualities or aptitude for higher math might often be
beneficial or good traits to have, but they are not necessarily moral
traits (i.e., they can be used to do bad actions, accomplish bad ends,
or lead to personal corruption). Virtues are traits like kindness,
wisdom, justice, and faithfulness -- qualities of character that, as the
Greek philosopher Aristotle put it, make people good and make their
actions good too (*Nichomachean Ethics* ii.6).

Since the virtue ethics framework asks the question “what would a
virtuous person do?” to determine what is right, if we want to use this
framework it is important to look at these positive character traits and
understand how they might inform the decisions of a virtuous person.

You will be considering several scenarios and trying to determine how a
virtuous person would respond. You will have the opportunity to list
which virtues you think would most influence the response.

### Discussion Guidelines

In this lab, students are asked to openly discuss virtues. To encourage
authentic engagement with the material and each other, you may need to
state some guidelines on expectations of peer-to-peer interaction. Here
are two suggestions from “Guidelines For Classroom Interactions”, the
Center for Research on Learning & Teaching, University of Michigan,
[<u>http://crlt.umich.edu/examples-discussion-guidelines</u>](http://crlt.umich.edu/examples-discussion-guidelines).

1.  **Understand that your words have effects on others.** Speak with
    care. If you learn that something you have said was experienced as
    disrespectful or marginalizing, listen carefully and try to
    understand that perspective. Learn how you can do better in the
    future.

2.  **Understand that others will come to these discussions with
    different experiences from yours.** Be careful about assumptions and
    generalizations you make based only on your experience. Be open to
    hearing and learning from other perspectives.
   
Ask students to keep these guidelines (or other similar guidelines) 
in mind as they discuss the scenarios in this lab.

### Activity (7-10 minutes)

Pass out papers with scenarios or point them to the scenarios you have
posted online. Allow students to consider the four scenarios either as
individuals or in small groups (3-4 students). Groups are probably best
if it is possible and they can be kept small.

### Changing it up

You could easily modify this activty by

* adding additional virtues to the list,
* modifying or replacing the particular scenarios,
* asking students to compare and contrast highly valued virtues in different cultures.

### Reflection (to be completed in class after the activity is finished) (10 minutes)

Suggestions for guiding student reflection

1. As time allows, **consider each scenario as a class** and have groups
   share their thoughts. (here are some ideas to help you prepare to
   lead the discussion)

    -   Professor made very hard assignment

        -   Professor could be honest about what she heard and ask for
            suggestions from students on how to handle the situation
            (virtues: hospitality, humility, transparency)

    -   Friend asks for help at last minute

        -   Student helps as much as possible during the hour left, but
            makes sure that the work is that of the friend. Encourages
            friend to turn in what they have, and offers to meet several
            days beforehand next time to help friend understand the
            assignment (virtues: integrity, compassion, patience,
            kindness)

    -   Last minute question for Lab Assistant

        -   Lab assistant looks at the error and suggests several
            concrete ways that the student could find it for themselves
            (print statements, debugger, check spelling etc.) (virtues:
            integrity, compassion, professionalism, respect)

    -   Heavy workload with grumbling students

        -   Virtuous students could figure out how much actual time is
            spent and iron out which complaints are valid and which are
            not. They could come up with ideas on how to learn the
            material in a way that is less cumbersome. They could
            suggest approaching the professor with evidence of the valid
            complaints (average number of hours spent on work, evidence
            that the book is not helpful). Virtues: patience, integrity,
            respect, initiative, honesty

2. It is quite possible that students will reach **different conclusions**
   about what a virtuous person would do, and will have different
   virtues that support their conclusions. Consider with the class what
   to make of this.

    -   Are some virtues to be ranked more highly?

    -   **This discovery also should lead to mentioning that a single
        ethical framework might not be enough. That is why we will be
        looking at other frameworks**.

3.  Ask the class if they think they would **naturally respond** in a
    virtuous way or if it would be hard. If some believe it would be
    hard, ask why.

    -   Possible answers: I’m not that good of a person, I wouldn’t want
        someone to be mad at me, my peer group would laugh at me.

4. Ask the class what the **benefits** might be **for a virtuous response** for
   each of the scenarios.

    -   A virtuous response from the professor would build trust between
        the professor and students

    -   A virtuous response to the friend (assuming they chose to no
        just give the code to their friend) would help the friend
        actually learn the material which would help on exams and future
        employment

    -   A virtuous response from the TA would help the student fix their
        own mistakes in the future, making the process less stressful

### Wrap Up (To be read or summarized)

We are not born with virtues, we develop
them over a lifetime through practice, imitating role models, and
reflecting on how the world around us forms our character.

Virtue ethicists suggest a number of 
**ways to cultivate virtue and good character**. 
Before I share some of them, what ideas do you have? 
(Give students time to suggest some.)

-   **Repeated intentional action.** Deliberately set out to create new
    habits. Structure your environment to give you reminders and make
    your new practices easier and create reminders and rewards
    periodically to keep yourself on track.

-   **Join a community** of people who already have and exercise this
    virtue.

-   **Find a role model** who has this virtue and spend time with that
    person, paying attention to their assessments and reactions to
    situations. What goods do they notice? What values move them to
    action? What considerations weigh (or don’t weigh) in their
    decision-making? What daily habits show them practicing that virtue?
    \[This can also work with historical or fictional persons if you can
    read about them at length.\]

    When you have to act, imagine what your role model would do or would
    counsel you to do (or get that person’s actual advice if you can).

## Assessment

These can be included later on a quiz, paper, or exam to
determine if learning objectives were reached.

1. Ask students to define “virtue.”

    -   Morally positive character traits

2. Ask students to describe how the virtue ethics framework could be
    applied to an ethical dilemma. You could provide a particular
    dilemma, or ask the students to provide an example.

3.  Ask students to reflect on two different virtues and indicate which
    (if either) they think is more important and why.

    -   Honesty and compassion, for example – not looking for a
        “correct” answer, but just their reasoning and articulation
        effort

4.  What are some of the challenges of using the virtue ethics framework
    alone

    -   Relative importance of virtues differ between people

    -   Sometimes hard to find the ‘better of 2 difficult choices’

5.  Give an example of acting virtuously along with the benefits it
    could produce

## Directions

Below are several scenarios.
Think about each of the following scenarios and determine how you
believe a virtuous person would respond. It might help to think about a
person, real or fictional, who you would consider to be highly moral and
decide how they might act. Then, try to determine which virtues
(character traits) would be most likely to influence them to act that
way.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Difficult assignment

A professor has made a new assignment that is more difficult for
students than she expected. She finds out by overhearing them
before class how much time they spent on it and how frustrated
they were. If she is a virtuous person, how should she respond?
What action should she take?

What virtues will guide her as she assesses and responds to this
situation?

### Scenario 2: Assignment deadline approaching

A student has a good friend who comes to him 1 hour before an assignment is due
asking for help. The student finds out that the friend has not actually started
the program yet. The professor has made it clear that submitted assignments are
to be a student’s own work. What does the virtuous student do?

What virtues will guide him as he assesses and responds to this
situation?

### Scenario 3: Office hours

A lab assistant is just about to finish his office hour. His
professor has told him that she can’t pay him for more than that
one hour. The lab assistant also has some assignments to finish up
for his own work. A student shows up with a syntax error that she
just can’t fix. What does the virtuous TA do?

What virtues will guide him as he assesses and responds to this
situation?

### Scenario 4: Too much homework

A professor has assigned way too much homework for several weeks in
a row. All of the students are complaining to each other about it.
What, if any, action should a virtuous student who is aware of
this situation take?

What virtues will guide her as she assesses and responds to this
situation?

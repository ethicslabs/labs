# Virtue Ethics

An ethical decision-making framework derived from the 
**moral values that a society has in common**. 

Examples of moral values (also called virtues) might
include compassion, courage, generosity, gratitude, honesty, humility,
inclusion, integrity, justice, mercy, open-mindedness, perseverance, respect,
and transparency, but there are many others. An activity might be considered
unethical it if conflicts with one or more of a society’s virtues.

### Key Question

* What sort of person would act this way?

# Deontological Ethics 

Determining whether something is right or wrong is based on **adherence to certain
moral principles** such as traffic laws, a company’s code of ethics, or The Ten
Commandments. 

In a government context, this set of principles might be the US
Constitution or the UN Charter of Human Rights. The primary computing
organization (the ACM) has its own code of ethics as do many business,
scientific, and medical organizations. A well-known principal from the American
Medical Association is "Do no harm". Another deontological principle could be
"Give credit where it is due."

### Key Question

* What rules does this uphold/violate?

---

# Utilitarianism

The ethics of a situation is decided by performing a **cost-benefit analysis**.
A course of action is more ethical if it brings **more benefit to more people**
(or causes less harm).

For example, vaccinations are considered to be the
ethical choice by most in our society because they protect the general
population (the majority stakeholder) from spread of disease.

### Key Questions

* Who benifits from this action? How much?
* Who is harmed by this action? How much?

---

# Analogy

Analogy is not so much a framework as a strategy. Sometimes investigating 
the ethics of an analogous situation helps shed light on the situation 
of interest.

### Key Question

* What other similar situation can help me understand how I should act?

### Read

Two companies that failed internationally due to cultural differences are Pepsi
and Coca Cola. According to Kwintessential, both beverage giants had issues when
first moving into the China market. Coca Cola named their product a Chinese
phrase that would sound like the original name. However, this new phrase
translated to "Bite the Wax Tadpole" This didnâ€™t go over well. 

Pepsi brought a new slogan to the Chinese market. It was 
"Pepsi brings you back to life".
Unfortunately the phrase translated to 
"Pepsi brings your ancestors back to life." 

Both companies had to revamp their Chinese campaigns.

One of the most sensitive touchstones to any culture is its religion. The misuse
of religious iconography can damage a company's image with those customers.
During the 1994 World Cup, bottles of Heineken beer displayed the flags of all
the participants in soccer's biggest tournament, including Saudi Arabia. The
country's flag shows a verse from the Quran, Islam's holy book. The Quran
forbids the use of alcohol, so thousands of Muslims registered complaints with
the brewer for displaying the verse.

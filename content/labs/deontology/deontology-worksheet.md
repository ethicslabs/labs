title: What grade should a student receive?
---

## Scenario 

After taking the final exam, a student's course grade is
59.5% (on a scale where passing is 60%).

## Discussion

1. Address the grade assignment using a virtue ethics framework.

    What grade would the virtuous professor assign? Would it make a
difference if the grade was between an A- and an A? What virtues would
be involved in the decision?

2. Address the grade assignment using deontology.

    You have been asked to write a program that will determine grades so
that the grade assignment is less subjective. Come up with an algorithm
(for that program) for assigning grades when a student is near the 
borderline between two grades.

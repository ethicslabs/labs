Integrated Ethics Labs (ie:Labs) was started by Lori Carter at
Point Loma Nazarene University in 2017 for use in computer science classes. 
Since then the team has expanded to include a number of authors and developers
from different institutions and disciplines.  

Find out more about the general aproach [here](/progressive-approach/) or see our
[list of available labs](/labs-overview/).  

We welcome comments, questions, suggestions, and feedback in the

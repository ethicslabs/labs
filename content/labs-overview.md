# Introductory Labs 

The following list of labs are the introductory labs for this
curriculum. These labs are designed to highlight the need for ethics
education in computer and data science.

## Why Ethics?

Motivates the need for ethics education in the context of what
computer and data scientists do. Great for early courses as students
learn about potential careers in computer/ data science and that with
great power comes great responsibility.

## Core Values

This is an introductory lab. The discussion centers on how a future
workplace is chosen (not really an ethical dilemma). The lab is
designed to help students reflect on the connection between choice and
personal value and articulate what might influence a person’s choice.

## A first Look at Ethics in Computer and Data Sciences

This lab briefly covers the first three ethical frameworks (virtue,
deontology and utilitarianism), gives the opportunity to practice
applying the different ethical frameworks to arrive at potential
solutions and recognize the connection between actions and values. The
placement of this lab can be used after the [*Why Ethics*](why-ethics/) 
lab, before the [*Virtue Ethics*](virtue-ethics/) lab or can be used to 
build an ethical foundation for later labs, if the other foundation labs are not used.
The lab is written to be an out of class assignment, however can be
adapted to be used in class.

# Foundational Labs

These labs that build a foundation in ethics. 
The first four labs discuss four ethical frameworks that are used in the
rest of the curriculum. 
The use of these framework tools is encouraged
throughout the curriculum as a way of pushing students to reason through
the big picture and potential solutions rather than simply voicing an
impulsive opinion.

**We strongly recommend building the foundational labs into your 
program; 
they build the foundation for the rest of the ie:Labs curriculum.** 
However, if it is not possible to do these four labs, then we recommend using
[*A first Look at Ethics in Computer and Data Sciences*](first-look/). This lab
will briefly survey the first three ethical frameworks.

## Virtue Ethics

Students start intentionally thinking about the ethical choices made
by students, teaching assistants, professors as they complete, assist
with, and grade programming assignments. The virtue ethics framework
is introduced as a way to evaluate the ethicality of actions. Ex: What
virtues would be violated or upheld if a professor denied an extension
on a programming assignment to a student in a car accident saying that
it would be unfair to the other students? While the scenarios in this
lab are written for an introductory programming course, they can be
easily adapted to other courses.

## Introduction to the Deontology Framework Using AI

In this lab students will encounter the ethical framework of
deontology, review and contrast with the virtue ethics and practice
finding an ethical solution in a group setting. It is recommended that
either [*Virtue Ethics*](virtue-ethics/) and/or 
[*A First Look at Ethics in Computer and Data Science*](first-look/) 
be used prior to this lab.

## Utilitarianism: Plagiarism Issues

To evaluate a dilemma employing utilitarian ethics, one would look at
which solution produces the most amount of utility, which can be
measured by happiness, good, benefits, etc. to the stakeholders. This
lab introduces utilitarianism frameworks and applies this framework to
two scenarios of plagiarism. Virtue and deontological ethics are
reviewed and contrasted with echo other and utilitarianism. While the
scenarios in this lab are written for a Calculus course, they can be
easily adapted to other courses.

## Analogies: Coding-Writing Plagiarism Example

This lab gives an introduction to analogies as a way to evaluate
ethical dilemmas. While analogies are not a common ethical framework,
they are helpful when exploring the ethicality of new ideas/products
by using analogies to known older ideas/ products. In this lab, the
concept of analogies and how they can help us make decisions about the
ethicality of a situation is discussed, along with variations/ degrees
of plagiarism in writing computer code. This lab is designed to be
used in an introduction to programming course, however could be
adapted to other types of courses by changing the scenarios.

# Application Labs

These labs are designed to be used in years two through four. They are
more applied to content in specific courses. For example, an ethics lab
to be integrated into a Data Analysis course might deal with the
potential for unethical choices in data cleaning, while a lab to be
integrated into a Software Engineering course might deal with addictive
aspects of certain software products.

## Hospitality in Computer Programming

Hospitality is defined by Dictionary.com as “the friendly reception
and treatment of guests or strangers”. The guests and strangers for
computer programmers are users and maintenance programmers. This lab
helps motivate the need for good variable names, comments, and user
messages using an engaging exercise where students must guess how to
play a game from its very cryptic prompts. Hospitable code helps to
keep it easy to update and bug free.

## Avoiding Algorithmic Bias

Students are introduced to predictive algorithms that were created
with the good intent of providing objective results but instead
included significant bias. They first consider the familiar college
admissions algorithm, and move to others that have become notorious.
They are then given the opportunity to consider how the algorithms
could have been improved if they had been vetted with the set of
guidelines recently released by the EU.

## Media Literacy (Choosing resources for background research)

Many students get all of their information from social media. It is
often one-sided and not fact-checked. Through the analogy of the best
set of witnesses for a trial, students are helped to understand that
it is important to read multiple, reliable sources with differing
views when doing background research. This lab contains both pre-class
and in-class assignments. Also, this lab is easily adaptable for a
variety of courses since references to technology are made, however no
specific knowledge is needed.

## Open Source Accessibility

Students have a limited view of what accessibility means. This lab
helps students to understand the accessibility features that can be
built into software. Students learn about open source software (which
is economically accessible) and consider how it fares in comparison to
proprietary software with regard to accessibility features required
for those who are physically, mentally, or emotionally impaired. This
lab contains both pre-class and in-class assignments.

## Data Cleaning (data integrity)

The goal of this lab is to show that data cleaning, while necessary,
can be conducted with differing degrees of ethicality. The process of
correcting data (changing location, imputing a new value, removing
typos etc.), removing incomplete records, or leaving questionable data
as it can affect the results of the analysis. Consequently, methods
must be scrutinized. Students will evaluate the ethical ramifications
of data cleaning choices on a fictional data set description.

## Ethics in E-Commerce: Digital Nudging

This lab considers ethics in E-Commerce. It explores how pre-set
choices on webpages can “nudge” a person to choose options that are
not in their best interest. A dilemma to be considered here is the
tension between a company making money by encouraging customers to buy
their product or to upgrade and the resulting positive or negative
experience for the consumer. Ethical issues include transparency and
dignity.

## Professional Ethics

While this lab reviews issues in professional ethics (sexual
harassment, using company resources properly, padding expense reports,
product safety), the emphasis is on preparing students to actually
speak up when they see something that is wrong. It explores reasons we
may want to remain quiet or why we might be tempted to do something
outside of our normal character.

## Transparency 

Transparency has become an issue in computing lately, including
transparency in how an AI makes decisions or how a predictive
algorithm produces results. This lab focuses on end user licensing
agreements. Such agreements are required for user and company safety,
but are often unread. Using online tools, students explore the actual
complexity of such agreements, consider solutions, and contemplate how
to discuss the solutions with their superiors.

## Reliability

Poorly tested software has led to life-ending disasters, child support
payments being misdirected, and patients being overdosed. This lab
explores the need and methods for thorough testing, but also looks at
the role of issues such as the needs for diverse teams when building
robust software. (this one is currently a work in progress)

# Capstone Labs

*The captstone labs are currently under construction.*

These labs are designed to help students review and pull together
concepts that they have learned in the ethics curriculum. In each lab,
students will be asked to identify a potential ethical dilemma and
evaluate possible approaches to the dilemma using the framework tools
taught in this curriculum.

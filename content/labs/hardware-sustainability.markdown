# Student materials

-   [Hardware Sustainability Handout](hardware-sustainability-handout)

# Overview

**Ethics background required:**
Ideally, students should be familiar with the 4 ethical frameworks presented in
the first year curriculum (virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism,
analogies). If they (or the professor) are not, a brief summary is provided in
the reflection.

**Subject matter** referred to in this lab:
technological devices and sustainability.

**Placement** in overall ethics curriculum:

-   This lab is suitable for any course considering the designing of a product and
    the impact on the environment. We recommend a 3rd or 4th year computer
    architecture or systems course or similar engineering course.

-   Recommended previous labs: Foundational labs.

-   Recommended follow-up labs: None

**Time** required:

-   Out of class: None;

-   In class: 45 minutes

**Learning objectives:** Students will

-   Recognize ethical issues and dilemmas that surround prolific production of
    technology.

-   Apply different frameworks to the dilemma of whether to continue the
    production of technology at the speed with which we have been.

-   Articulate independent conclusions regarding the ethical dilemma.

**Ethical dilemma or issue** to be considered:

-   Dilemma: Should we continue to produce technology at the current rate in the
    U.S.?
-   Issue: sustainability, e-waste.

With more technological innovation, people are able to do things they never
could before. Healthcare is available to rural areas. Businesses are making more
money. However, as humans create more technology, we also create more e-waste.
Should we continue to develop new technology knowing it creates more waste?
Where and how should we dispose of our e-waste? This lab is designed to get
students to identify one or more ethical dilemmas and evaluate them through an
ethical framework.

**Flow**

-   Identification of possible issues: Students will place their electronics on
    their desk in front of them as a visual of the amount of technology used by a
    single person.

-   Students and professor will explore the value and challenges of the prolific
    production of electronic devices.

-   Students will reflect on the ethicality of such production and resulting
    disposal requirements using a variety of ethical frameworks.

**Preparation:**
Read through the entire lab. Prepare a slide for the introduction (if needed) and print out student handouts.

# Guide for Instructors

## Lesson plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)

**Read or summarize to students:** Today we are going to look at the ways that
the prolific production of new technology affects our lives. New devices
increase our ability to communicate, provide healthcare to rural areas, and make
our lives more fun and efficient. However, there are downsides as well. Some of
those downsides are ethically questionable. We will consider together these ups
and downs and questions to consider when new technology is produced.

-   Have students place their phones, laptops, calculators, chargers, and any other electronics all together on their desk or table in front of them; allow students to observe and note how much electronics exist in just one class.

### Activity (20 minutes)

**Divide the class into groups of 2-3** and assign each group to answer one of
the 7 questions on the student handout by looking for resources online. We have
provided some answers that were correct when the lab was written just
to give you, the instructor, an idea. (10 minutes)

Question #1: How have personal electronic devices improved medicine?

-   Electrocardiogram on your phone, send blood glucose levels via phone

-   Detecting skin cancer and ear infections

    <https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/smartphones-are-changing-medical-care-some-surprising-ways-ncna810561>

Question #2: How have electronics in general improved medicine?

-   Smart inhalers, robotic surgery, artificial organs (using 3D printers)

    <https://www.proclinical.com/blogs/2019-2/top-10-new-medical-technologies-of-2019>

Question #3: How have electronic devices improved the environment?

-   Carbon collection devices controlled by AI

Question #4: How many mobile devices do individuals have on average? Why are people not keeping their devices longer?

-   More mobile devices than people

    <https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world>

-   People want the new features, and sometimes phones are required to be replaced rather than repaired

    <https://www.ewaste1.com/benefits-of-e-waste-recycling/>

Question #5: What is e-waste, and how much e-waste accumulates in one year?

-   176 pounds per family per year.

    <https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/e-waste-monitor-report-glut/>

Question #6: Can e-waste be recycled? What are the benefits?

-   E-waste can and should be recycled. If left in landfills, the metals from the technology can contaminate the groundwater among other things

    <https://www.ewaste1.com/benefits-of-e-waste-recycling/>

Question #7: Where is e-waste from the U.S. currently discarded?

-   The U.S. currently disposes of its e-waste in other countries.

**Bring the students back together to report** their answers to the assigned question (10 minutes).

### Reflection as a class (20 minutes)

-   **Ask students what the ethical dilemma is.**

    -   They should see that discontinuing the creation of these devices could keep
        people from getting the help they need or making life less efficient. It might
        also eliminate jobs for those designing and manufacturing them. But,
        continuing the creation of these devices can be detrimental to the
        environment, particularly in other countries where the waste is sent. There
        are other problems as well: devise addiction, people spending money they don’t
        have etc.

-   **Question to the class**: Assume that you are a high-level employee in a
    company that is considering creating a new version of an existing device. You
    are asked your opinion on whether this next version should go forward. Argue,
    using one of the ethical frameworks with which you are familiar (and are
    summarized on your handout) or the analogies tool, whether you should or should
    not move forward with this product. Feel free to state assumptions that you have
    made or questions that you would have for the supervisor asking for your
    input. **Give 5 minutes to formulate their ideas using one framework.**

-   After the class has reconvened, **go through each framework** and get arguments
    from each person who chose that approach. Here are some possible ideas in case
    no one has one for a particular approach:

    -   **Virtue ethics**: It would really depend on what this new device could
        contribute. If it would add some new accessibility feature for a marginalized
        portion of society, then compassion, kindness, and inclusivity would be a focus.
        The virtuous person would probably also ask if a software upgrade could do the
        same thing to address the sustainability issue. If it was just additional
        entertainment value, or ease of use, the virtuous person might choose against
        the creation for sustainability reasons. At the same time they should think of a
        solution for keeping designers and manufacturers employed.

    -   **Deontology**: A set of rules might require a certain number of new features
        before a new device is actually made. It might require that all updates that can
        be included via software, be included. It might limit the number of hardware
        changes allowed each year. It might require manufacturers to use certain more
        easily recyclable materials if a new device was to be created. A student could
        also refer to a set of rules in existence. For example, the ACM code of ethics
        has principles “Do no harm” and “Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations
        of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.”

    -   **Utilitarianism:** The stakeholders would be designers, manufacturers,
        consumers from various demographics, and the environment. Careful consideration
        would have to be paid to who the new features would benefit. Chances are that
        since a new device would benefit all employees and perhaps many others, the
        emphasis would need to be on reducing the cost – focusing on more sustainable
        materials, maybe at the cost of increased power, battery-life, or speed. Another
        way to reduce societal cost would be to find a lower population area to dispose
        of waste.

A student could, however, argue that the effects on the environment would harm not only people, but wildlife and greenery, thus making the costs the bigger impact

-   **Analogy** might be cars and pollution.

### Assessment

1.  Identify the ethical dilemma concerning e-waste and technology.

2.  Give two examples of how technology has benefited our society.

3.  Current approaches to AI produce highly accurate results at the cost of
    executing an enormous amount of instructions thus contributing to a very high
    carbon footprint. Green AI is an area of research that tries to find a balance
    between accuracy and efficiency. Argue in support of Green AI using virtue
    ethics, deontology (is there a set of rules you can use?), or utilitarianism.

### Online teaching

This lesson is easily adapted to an asynchronous online environment where a
student would complete the assignment individually and then post some of their
ideas while also responding to the ideas of others.
